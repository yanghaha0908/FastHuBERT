MARGARET MET JE ##M W ##ILS ##ON SEVERAL DAYS AFTER HIS BROTHER ##S WERE SER ##IOUSLY ILL AND HEARD FROM HIM THE STATE OF THINGS AT HIS HOME
SHE STOPPED WITH HER HAND ON THE LA ##T ##CH OF THE W ##ILS ##ONS DOOR TO STILL HER BE ##ATING HEART AND LIST ##ENED TO THE HUS ##H ##ED QUIET WITHIN
SHE OPENED THE DOOR SOFT ##LY THERE SAT MISSUS W ##ILS ##ON IN THE OLD ROCK ##ING CHAIR WITH ONE S ##ICK DEATH LIKE BOY L ##YING ON HER KN ##EE CRY ##ING WITHOUT LET OR PA ##USE BUT SOFT ##LY GENT ##LY AS FEAR ##ING TO DIST ##UR ##B THE TROUBLE ##D G ##ASP ##ING CHILD WHILE BEHIND HER OLD AL ##ICE LET HER FAST DRO ##PPING TEARS FALL DOWN ON THE DEAD BODY OF THE OTHER TW ##IN WHICH SHE WAS LAY ##ING OUT ON A BO ##ARD PLACED ON A SORT OF SO ##F ##A SET ##TE ##E IN A CORN ##ER OF THE ROOM
OVER THE CHILD WHICH YET BREATH ##ED THE FATHER BE ##N ##T WATCH ##ING ANX ##IOUSLY FOR SOME GROUND OF HOPE WHERE HOPE THERE WAS NONE
IS THERE ANY CHANCE FOR THE OTHER ONE THINK YOU
BUT EAR ##NE ##ST AS THE FATHER WAS IN WATCH ##ING THE YET LIVING HE HAD EYES AND EAR ##S FOR ALL THAT CONCER ##NED THE DEAD AND SPR ##ANG GENT ##LY UP AND TOOK HIS DEAD SON ON HIS HARD CO ##U ##CH IN HIS ARMS WITH TEN ##DER STRENGTH AND CARRIED HIM UP ##ST ##AIRS AS IF AFRAID OF WA ##KE ##NING HIM
WISH ##ING HIM SAID MARY IN A TONE OF INQU ##IR ##Y
THEN THE MOTHER LI ##FT ##ED UP HER VOICE AND WE ##PT
HER CR ##IES BROUGHT HER HUSBAND DOWN TO TRY WITH HIS AC ##HING HEART TO COMFORT HER ##S
MARY AND AL ##ICE DREW NEAR THE FIRE AND STOOD IN QUIET SO ##R ##RO ##W FOR SOME TIME
THEN AL ##ICE BR ##OKE THE SILENCE BY SAYING
AF ##ORE CHRIST ##MA ##S TIME I WAS AS FULL AS FULL COULD BE OF GOING HOME FOR GOOD AND ALL Y ##O HA ##N HEARD HOW I ' VE WISH ##ED IT THIS TERRI ##BLE LONG TIME
BUT HE STAY ##ED LONG THERE AND AT LAST HIS ST ##UR ##DY FR ##AME SHO ##OK WITH HIS STRONG AGO ##NY
OH JE ##M DON ' T GIVE WAY SO I CANNOT BEAR TO SEE YOU
HE DID NOT SPEAK AS THOUGH FEAR ##ING TO DEST ##RO ##Y BY SOUND OR MOT ##ION THE HAPP ##INESS OF THAT MOMENT WHEN HER SOFT HAND ' S TOU ##CH THR ##ILLED THROUGH HIS FR ##AME AND HER SIL ##VER ##Y VOICE WAS WHIS ##PER ##ING TEN ##DER ##NESS IN HIS EAR
DON ' T JE ##M PLEASE DON ' T WHIS ##PER ##ED SHE AGAIN BELIE ##VING THAT HIS SILENCE WAS ONLY ANOTHER FORM OF GR ##IEF
MARY I ALMOST LO ##ATH ##E MYSELF WHEN I FEEL I WOULD NOT GIVE UP THIS MIN ##UTE WHEN MY BROTHER ##S LIE DEAD AND FATHER AND MOTHER ARE IN SUCH TROUBLE FOR ALL MY LIFE THAT ' S PAST AND GONE AND MARY AS SHE TRIED TO REL ##E ##ASE HER HAND YOU KNOW WHAT MAKES ME FEEL SO BL ##ESSED
HE REM ##AINED UP ST ##AIRS UNTIL AFTER THE EARLY DA ##WN SHOW ##ED MARY THAT SHE NEED HAVE NO FEAR OF GOING HOME THROUGH THE DES ##ERT ##ED AND QUIET STREET ##S TO TRY AND GET A LITTLE SLEEP BEFORE WORK HOUR
SO LEA ##VING KIND ME ##S ##S ##AGES TO GE ##OR ##GE AND J ##ANE W ##ILS ##ON AND HE ##S ##IT ##ATING WHETHER SHE MIGHT DA ##RE TO SEND A FEW KIND WORDS TO JE ##M AND DEC ##ID ##ING THAT SHE HAD BETTER NOT SHE STEP ##PE ##D OUT INTO THE BRIGHT MORNING LIGHT SO FRE ##SH A CONTR ##AST TO THE DARK ##ENED ROOM WHERE DEATH HAD BEEN
HER THOUGHTS RAN ON JE ##M ' S MANNER AND WORDS NOT BUT WHAT SHE HAD KNOWN THE T ##ALE THEY TOLD FOR MANY A DAY BUT STILL SHE WISH ##ED HE HAD NOT PUT IT SO PLAIN ##LY
I CANNOT THINK WHAT POSS ##ESS ##ES ME THAT I MUST ALWAYS BE WANT ##ING TO COMFORT HIM WHEN HE ' S DOWN ##C ##AST AND THAT I MUST GO MED ##D ##LING W ##I HIM TO NIGHT WHEN SURE ENOUGH IT WAS HIS AUNT ' S PLACE TO SPEAK TO HIM
I THINK I CANNOT GO RIGHT FOR I EITHER CHE ##CK MYSELF TILL I ' M DOWN ##RI ##GHT CROSS TO HIM OR ELSE I SPEAK JUST NATURAL AND THAT ' S TOO KIND AND TEN ##DER BY HALF
BUT WILL HE THAN ##K ME FOR IT
THERE WAS SOMETHING OF KE ##EN PRACT ##ICAL SH ##REW ##D ##NESS ABOUT HER WHICH CONTR ##AST ##ED VERY BE ##W ##ITCH ##INGLY WITH THE SIM ##PLE FOOL ##ISH UN ##W ##OR ##LD ##LY IDEA ##S SHE HAD P ##ICKED UP FROM THE ROM ##ANCES WHICH MISS SIM ##M ##OND ##S YOUNG LAD ##IES WERE IN THE HA ##BIT OF RECO ##M ##MEN ##D ##ING TO EACH OTHER YES
THE OLD LEAVE ##N INF ##USED YEARS AGO BY HER AUNT EST ##HER FE ##R ##MENT ##ED IN HER LITTLE BO ##SO ##M AND PERHAPS ALL THE MORE FOR HER FATHER ' S AV ##ERS ##ION TO THE RICH AND THE GENTLE
IT WAS A COMFORT TO HER WHEN SC ##OLD ##ED BY MISS SIM ##M ##OND ##S TO THINK OF THE DAY WHEN SHE WOULD DRI ##VE UP TO THE DOOR IN HER OWN CAR ##RIAGE TO ORDER HER GO ##WN ##S FROM THE HAST ##Y TEM ##PER ##ED YET KIND DRESS ##MA ##KE ##R
BUT THE BEST OF HER PLAN ##S THE HO ##L ##IEST THAT WHICH IN SOME ME ##AS ##URE RED ##EE ##MED THE VAN ##ITY OF THE REST WERE THOSE REL ##ATING TO HER FATHER HER DEAR FATHER NOW OPP ##RESSED WITH CARE AND ALWAYS A DIS ##H ##EAR ##TEN ##ED GL ##OOM ##Y PERSON
THEY SAT ABOUT THE HOUSE MOST OF THE DAY AS IF IT WERE SUN ##DAY GRE ##AS ##ING THEIR BO ##OTS MEN ##D ##ING THEIR SUS ##PEND ##ERS PLA ##ITING WH ##IP ##LA ##SH ##ES
ANY ##WAY HE WOULD NEVER ALL ##OW ONE OF HIS HORSE ##S TO BE PUT TO SUCH A STRA ##IN
I HAD WANTED TO GET SOME PICT ##URE BOOK ##S FOR Y ##UL ##K ##A AND AN ##TON ##IA EVEN Y ##UL ##K ##A WAS ABLE TO READ A LITTLE NOW
SHE CUT SQU ##ARE ##S OF CO ##T ##TON CLOTH AND WE SE ##W ##ED THEM TOGETHER INTO A BOOK
ON THE WHITE PA ##GE ##S I GR ##OU ##PE ##D SUN ##DAY SCHOOL CAR ##D ##S AND ADV ##ERT ##ISING CAR ##D ##S WHICH I HAD BROUGHT FROM MY OLD COUNTRY
WHEN HE MO ##UNT ##ED HIS HORSE AT THE DOOR I SAW THAT HE HAD A HAT ##CH ##ET SL ##UNG TO HIS BEL ##T AND HE GAVE GRAND ##M ##OTHER A MEAN ##ING LOOK WHICH TOLD ME HE WAS PLAN ##NING A SURPR ##ISE FOR ME
I PUT ON MY CAP AND RAN OUT TO MEET J ##AKE
HE USED TO HELP MY FATHER CUT CHRIST ##MA ##S TREES FOR ME IN VI ##R ##GIN ##IA AND HE HAD NOT FORGOT ##TEN HOW MUCH I LIKE ##D THEM
BY THE TIME WE HAD PLACED THE COLD FRE ##SH SM ##ELL ##ING LITTLE TREE IN A CORN ##ER OF THE SITTING ROOM IT WAS ALREADY CHRIST ##MA ##S EV ##E
FROM UNDER THE LI ##NING HE NOW PRODU ##CED A COLL ##ECT ##ION OF BR ##ILL ##IAN ##T ##LY COL ##ORED PAPER FIG ##URES SEVERAL INC ##H ##ES HIGH AND ST ##IFF ENOUGH TO STAND ALONE
I CAN SEE THEM NOW EXACT ##LY AS THEY LOOKED WORK ##ING ABOUT THE TABLE IN THE LA ##M ##PL ##IGHT J ##AKE WITH HIS HEAVY FE ##AT ##URES SO RU ##DE ##LY MO ##UL ##DE ##D THAT HIS FACE SEEMED SOME ##H ##OW UN ##F ##IN ##ISHED O ##T ##TO WITH HIS HALF EAR AND THE SA ##V ##AGE SCAR THAT MADE HIS UP ##PER LI ##P CUR ##L SO FE ##RO ##CIOUS ##LY UNDER HIS TW ##IST ##ED MUST ##ACH ##E
GRAND ##F ##ATHER CAME DOWN WE ##ARING A WHITE SH ##IRT AND HIS SUN ##DAY CO ##AT
MORNING PRAY ##ERS WERE LONGER THAN US ##UAL
HE GAVE THAN ##KS FOR OUR FOOD AND COMFORT AND PRAY ##ED FOR THE POOR AND DEST ##IT ##UTE IN GREAT C ##ITIES WHERE THE STR ##UGG ##LE FOR LIFE WAS HARD ##ER THAN IT WAS HERE WITH US
BECAUSE HE TALK ##ED SO LITTLE HIS WORDS HAD A PE ##CUL ##IAR FORCE THEY WERE NOT WOR ##N DU ##LL FROM CONST ##ANT USE
ALL AFTER ##N ##OON HE SAT IN THE DIN ##ING ROOM
AT ABOUT FOUR O ' CLOCK A VISIT ##OR APPEARED MISTER SH ##IME ##R ##D ##A WE ##ARING HIS RA ##B ##BIT SK ##IN CAP AND COLL ##AR AND NEW M ##ITT ##ENS HIS WIFE HAD KN ##ITTED
HE SAT STILL AND PASS ##IVE HIS HEAD REST ##ING AGAINST THE BACK OF THE WOOD ##EN ROCK ##ING CHAIR HIS HANDS REL ##A ##X ##ED UPON THE ARMS
HIS FACE HAD A LOOK OF WE ##AR ##INESS AND PLEASURE LIKE THAT OF S ##ICK PEOPLE WHEN THEY FEEL REL ##IEF FROM PAIN
HE MADE THE SIGN OF THE CROSS OVER ME PUT ON HIS CAP AND WENT OFF IN THE DARK
THE WEE ##K FOLLOW ##ING CHRIST ##MA ##S BROUGHT IN A TH ##AW AND BY NEW YEAR ' S DAY ALL THE WORLD ABOUT US WAS A BR ##OTH OF GRA ##Y SL ##USH AND THE GU ##T ##TERED SL ##OP ##E BETWEEN THE WIND ##M ##ILL AND THE BAR ##N WAS RUN ##NING BLACK WATER
IT WAS THE FIRST TIME MISSUS SH ##IME ##R ##D ##A HAD BEEN TO OUR HOUSE AND SHE RAN ABOUT EXAM ##INING OUR CAR ##PE ##TS AND CUR ##TAIN ##S AND FUR ##N ##IT ##URE ALL THE WHILE COMM ##ENT ##ING UPON THEM TO HER DAUGHTER IN AN EN ##V ##IOUS COMP ##LA ##INING TONE
YOUR MA ##MA I SAID ANG ##RI ##LY WANT ##S OTHER PEOPLE ' S THINGS
FOR AM ##BR ##OS ##CH MY MA ##MA COME HERE
BUT YOU SEE A BODY NEVER KNOW ##S WHAT TRA ##ITS PO ##VER ##TY MIGHT BRING OUT IN EM
THEY BEGAN TO LAUGH BO ##ISTER ##OUSLY WHEN THEY SAW ME CALL ##ING
YOU ' VE GOT A B ##IRT ##H ##DAY PRESENT THIS TIME J ##IM AND NO MIST ##AKE
SHE WAS FOUR YEARS OLD ##ER THAN I TO BE SURE AND HAD SEEN MORE OF THE WORLD BUT I WAS A BOY AND SHE WAS A GIRL AND I RES ##ENTED HER PROT ##ECT ##ING MANNER
THIS CHANGE CAME ABOUT FROM AN ADV ##ENT ##URE WE HAD TOGETHER
ONE DAY WHEN I RO ##DE OVER TO THE SH ##IME ##R ##D ##AS I FOUND AN ##TON ##IA START ##ING OFF ON FOOT FOR RU ##S ##S ##IAN PE ##TER ' S HOUSE TO BO ##R ##RO ##W A SP ##ADE AM ##BR ##OS ##CH NEED ##ED
THERE HAD BEEN ANOTHER BLACK FR ##OST THE NIGHT BEFORE AND THE AIR WAS CLEAR AND HEAD ##Y AS WIN ##E
IT WAS ON ONE OF THESE GRA ##VEL BED ##S THAT I MET MY ADV ##ENT ##URE
I WH ##IRL ##ED ROUND AND THERE ON ONE OF THOSE DR ##Y GRA ##VEL BED ##S WAS THE BIG ##GE ##ST SN ##AKE I HAD EVER SEEN
I KNOW I AM JUST AW ##FUL J ##IM I WAS SO SCAR ##ED
I NEVER KNOW YOU WAS SO BRA ##VE J ##IM SHE WENT ON COMFORT ##INGLY
A FA ##INT FE ##T ##ID SM ##ELL CAME FROM HIM AND A THR ##EAD OF GREEN LI ##QU ##ID O ##O ##Z ##ED FROM HIS CR ##USHED HEAD
LOOK TO ##NY THAT ' S HIS PO ##ISON I SAID
I EXPL ##AINED TO AN ##TON ##IA HOW THIS MEANT THAT HE WAS TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD THAT HE MUST HAVE BEEN THERE WHEN WHITE MEN FIRST CAME LEFT ON FROM BU ##FF ##AL ##O AND IND ##IAN TIMES
WE DEC ##IDED THAT AN ##TON ##IA SHOULD RID ##E DU ##DE HOME AND I WOULD WALK
I FOLLOWED WITH THE SP ##ADE OVER MY SHOULD ##ER DRA ##GG ##ING MY SN ##AKE
O ##T ##TO F ##U ##CH ##S WAS THE FIRST ONE WE MET
HE COULD STAND RIGHT UP AND TALK TO YOU HE COULD DID HE FIGHT HARD
O ##T ##TO WIN ##KED AT ME
A SN ##AKE OF HIS S ##IZE IN FIGHT ##ING TRI ##M WOULD BE MORE THAN ANY BOY COULD HAND ##LE
PE ##TER TOLD HIS TROUBLE ##S TO MISTER SH ##IME ##R ##D ##A HE WAS UN ##ABLE TO MEET A NOT ##E WHICH FELL DU ##E ON THE FIRST OF NO ##VE ##MB ##ER HAD TO PAY AN EX ##OR ##BIT ##ANT BO ##N ##US ON RE ##NE ##W ##ING IT AND TO GIVE A MOR ##T ##G ##AGE ON HIS P ##IG ##S AND HORSE ##S AND EVEN HIS MIL ##K CO ##W
PE ##TER COULD GIVE NO VERY CLEAR ACCOUNT OF HIS TRANS ##ACT ##IONS WITH CUT ##TER
SHE ASKED PE ##TER TO WAIT A MOMENT AND WHEN SHE CAME BACK FROM THE K ##ITCH ##EN SHE BROUGHT A B ##AG OF SA ##ND ##W ##ICH ##ES AND DO ##UG ##HN ##UT ##S FOR US
WE LAY STILL AND DID NOT TALK
THE LITTLE HOUSE ON THE HILL ##SIDE WAS SO MUCH THE COL ##OR OF THE NIGHT THAT WE COULD NOT SEE IT AS WE CAME UP THE DRAW
THEY MADE ME THINK OF DEF ##E ##ATED ARM ##IES RET ##REAT ##ING OR OF G ##H ##OST ##S WHO WERE TRY ##ING DESP ##ER ##ATELY TO GET IN FOR SHE ##LT ##ER AND THEN WENT MO ##AN ##ING ON
I COULD NOT TAKE MY EYES OFF THE MAN IN THE BED
THE SHAR ##P SM ##ELL OF SPIRIT ##S WENT THROUGH THE ROOM
IT SEEMED TO ME THAT HE DESP ##ISED HIM FOR BEING SO SIM ##PLE AND DO ##CI ##LE
THE S ##ICK MAN RA ##GED AND SHO ##OK HIS F ##IST
HE SEEMED TO BE CUR ##S ##ING PEOPLE WHO HAD WRONG ##ED HIM
QUICKLY IT WAS COVER ##ED WITH BRIGHT RED SP ##OTS I THOUGHT I HAD NEVER SEEN ANY BLOOD SO BRIGHT
HE LAY PAT ##IENT ##LY FIGHT ##ING FOR BREATH LIKE A CHILD WITH CR ##OU ##P
AN ##TON ##IA ' S FATHER UNC ##OVE ##RED ONE OF HIS LONG BO ##NY LEG ##S AND RU ##B ##BED IT R ##H ##Y ##TH ##M ##ICALLY
FROM OUR BE ##N ##CH WE COULD SEE WHAT A HO ##LLOW CASE HIS BODY WAS
GRA ##DU ##ALLY REL ##IEF CAME TO ALL OF US
WITHOUT A WORD PE ##TER GOT UP AND LI ##T HIS LA ##N ##TERN
MISTER SH ##IME ##R ##D ##A WENT WITH HIM
AFTER THE CE ##RE ##M ##ONY AT THE CHURCH THE PARTY WENT TO A DINNER GIVEN BY THE PAR ##ENTS OF THE BR ##IDE
THE FIRST HOW ##LS WERE TAKEN UP AND E ##CH ##O ##ED AND WITH QUICK ##ENING REPE ##T ##ITION ##S
A BLACK DRO ##VE CAME UP OVER THE HILL BEHIND THE WE ##D ##D ##ING PARTY
SOMETHING HAPPENED TO THE H ##IND ##MOST SLE ##D ##GE THE DRI ##VER LOST CONTR ##OL HE WAS PROB ##ABLY VERY DR ##UN ##K THE HORSE ##S LEFT THE ROAD THE SLE ##D ##GE WAS CAUGHT IN A CL ##UMP OF TREES AND OVER ##T ##URN ##ED
THE SH ##RIE ##KS THAT FOLLOWED MADE EVERY ##BODY SO ##BER
THE ROAD WAS CLEAR AND WHITE AND THE GR ##OOM ' S THREE BLACK ##S WENT LIKE THE WIND
THERE ARE ONLY THREE SLE ##D ##GE ##S LEFT HE WHIS ##PER ##ED
AND THE WO ##L ##VES PA ##VEL ASKED ENOUGH ENOUGH FOR ALL OF US
THEY WERE WITHIN A FEW MILES OF THEIR VILL ##AGE NOW
YES HOW MANY
TWENTY THIRTY ENOUGH
NOW HIS MID ##DLE HORSE WAS BEING ALMOST DRA ##GG ##ED BY THE OTHER TWO
PA ##VEL KN ##OCK ##ED HIM OVER THE SIDE OF THE SLE ##D ##GE AND THR ##EW THE GIRL AFTER HIM
PE ##TER CR ##OU ##CHING IN THE FRONT SEA ##T SAW NOTHING
THE FIRST THING EITHER OF THEM NOT ##ICED WAS A NEW SOUND THAT BR ##OKE INTO THE CLEAR AIR LO ##UDE ##R THAN THEY HAD EVER HEARD IT BEFORE THE BELL OF THE MON ##ASTER ##Y OF THEIR OWN VILL ##AGE R ##ING ##ING FOR EARLY PRAY ##ERS
THEY WERE RUN OUT OF THEIR VILL ##AGE
WHERE ##VER THEY WENT THE STORY FOLLOWED THEM
THEY WORK ##ED IN CH ##IC ##AG ##O DES MO ##INES FORT WAY ##NE BUT THEY WERE ALWAYS UN ##FORT ##UN ##ATE
DURING THE A ##UCT ##ION HE WENT ABOUT WITH HIS HEAD DOWN AND NEVER LI ##FT ##ED HIS EYES
EVERY ONE SAID PE ##TER K ##ISS ##ED THE CO ##W BEFORE SHE WAS LED AWAY BY HER NEW OWN ##ER
THE LO ##S ##S OF HIS TWO FRIENDS HAD A DEP ##RESS ##ING EFFECT UPON OLD MISTER SH ##IME ##R ##D ##A
WHEN HE WAS OUT H ##UNT ##ING HE USED TO GO INTO THE EM ##PT ##Y LO ##G HOUSE AND SIT THERE BR ##OOD ##ING
THIS CA ##B ##IN WAS HIS HER ##M ##IT ##AGE UNTIL THE WIN ##TER SNOW ##S PEN ##NED HIM IN HIS CA ##VE
THROUGH ##OUT THIS CENT ##URY THE POWER OF THE CHURCH WAS CONST ##ANTLY ON THE INC ##RE ##ASE AND IS VIS ##IBLE IN MANY IMPORT ##ANT CHANGE ##S

HOW WONDER ##FULLY RES ##P ##ONS ##IVE TO EVERY EM ##OT ##ION OF THE HUMAN SOUL
FEW ##ER WORDS THAN BEFORE BUT WITH THE SAME MY ##STER ##IOUS MUS ##IC IN THEM

AT SOME UNC ##ERTAIN PER ##I ##OD IN THE DEP ##TH ##S OF NIGHT AND AS IT WERE THROUGH THE TH ##IN VE ##IL OF A DREAM SHE WAS CONS ##CIOUS OF A FOOT ##ST ##EP MO ##UNT ##ING THE ST ##AIRS HEAV ##ILY BUT NOT WITH FORCE AND DEC ##IS ##ION
MIN ##N ##IE ' S FL ##AT AS THE ONE FLOOR RES ##IDENT AP ##ART ##MENTS WERE THEN BEING CALLED WAS IN A PART OF WE ##ST VAN BUR ##EN STREET IN ##H ##AB ##ITED BY FAM ##IL ##IES OF LAB ##OUR ##ERS AND CLE ##R ##KS MEN WHO HAD COME AND WERE STILL COMING WITH THE RU ##SH OF PO ##P ##UL ##ATION PO ##URING IN AT THE RA ##TE OF FIFTY THOUSAND A YEAR
TO CAR ##RIE THE SOUND OF THE LITTLE BELL ##S UPON THE HORSE CAR ##S AS THEY T ##INK ##LED IN AND OUT OF HEAR ##ING WAS AS PLEAS ##ING AS IT WAS NO ##VEL
TO HIM THE PRES ##ENCE OR ABS ##ENCE OF HIS WIFE ' S SISTER WAS A MATTER OF IND ##IFF ##ERE ##N ##CE
HE WAS OF A CLE ##AN SA ##VING DISP ##OSITION AND HAD ALREADY PA ##ID A NUMBER OF MONTH ##LY INST ##AL ##MENTS ON TWO LO ##TS FAR OUT ON THE WE ##ST SIDE
HIS AM ##BIT ##ION WAS SOME DAY TO BUILD A HOUSE ON THEM
SHE HAD SOME SLIGHT GI ##FT OF OBSER ##V ##ATION AND THAT SENSE SO RICH IN EVERY WOMAN INT ##U ##ITION
THE WALL ##S OF THE ROOM ##S WERE DISC ##ORD ##ANTLY PAPER ##ED
THE FLOOR ##S WERE COVER ##ED WITH MAT ##TING AND THE HALL LAID WITH A TH ##IN RA ##G CAR ##PE ##T
THEN SHE WALKED AND SA ##NG TO IT UNTIL HA ##N ##SON DIST ##UR ##BED IN HIS READ ##ING CAME AND TOOK IT
ONE COULD SEE THAT HE WAS VERY MUCH WR ##APP ##ED UP IN HIS OFF ##S ##PR ##ING
NOW NOW HE SAID WALK ##ING THERE THERE AND THERE WAS A CERTAIN SWE ##D ##ISH ACC ##ENT NOT ##ICE ##ABLE IN HIS VOICE
HE SEEMED TO BE THINKING OF SOMETHING ELSE
MIN ##N ##IE BEGAN TO EXPL ##AIN BUT HER HUSBAND TOOK THIS PART OF THE CONVERS ##ATION TO HIMSELF
YOU COULD GET HOME EAS ##Y TOO IT IS ##N ' T VERY FAR
SHE ASKED MIN ##N ##IE FOR IN ##K AND PAPER WHICH WERE UPON THE MAN ##TE ##L IN THE DIN ##ING ROOM AND WHEN THE LA ##T ##TER HAD GONE TO BED AT TEN GOT OUT DRO ##UE ##T ' S CAR ##D AND WR ##OTE HIM
SHE WANTED TO MAKE SOME REF ##ERE ##N ##CE TO THEIR REL ##ATIONS UPON THE TRA ##IN BUT WAS TOO TIM ##ID
ANYTHING WAS GOOD ENOUGH SO LONG AS IT PA ##ID SAY FIVE DO ##LL ##ARS A WEE ##K TO BEGIN WITH
A SHO ##P GIRL WAS THE DEST ##IN ##Y PRE ##F ##IG ##URED FOR THE NEW ##CO ##MER
IT WAS UNDER SUCH A ##US ##P ##IC ##IOUS CIRCUMST ##ANCES THAT SHE START ##ED OUT THIS MORNING TO LOOK FOR WORK
N ##ARR ##OW BO ##ARD WALK ##S EXT ##END ##ED OUT PASS ##ING HERE A HOUSE AND THERE A STO ##RE AT FAR INTER ##VAL ##S EVEN ##T ##UALLY END ##ING ON THE OPEN PR ##AIR ##IE
IT GAVE AN IMP ##OS ##ING APPEAR ##ANCE TO MOST OF THE WHOLE ##S ##ALE HOUSE ##S WHOSE OFFIC ##ES WERE UPON THE GROUND FLOOR AND IN PLAIN VIEW OF THE STREET
THESE V ##AST BUILD ##INGS WHAT WERE THEY
HE WAS IN A FE ##VER ##ED STATE OF MIND O ##W ##ING TO THE BL ##IGHT HIS WIFE ' S ACT ##ION THR ##E ##ATE ##NED TO CAST UPON HIS ENTIRE F ##UT ##URE
HE WOULD HAVE TO PAY HER THE MONEY WHICH SHE WOULD NOW REG ##ULAR ##LY DEM ##AND OR THERE WOULD BE TROUBLE IT DID NOT MATTER WHAT HE DID
HUR ##ST ##W ##OOD WALKED THE FLOOR MEN ##T ##ALLY ARR ##ANG ##ING THE CHIEF POINT ##S OF HIS SIT ##U ##ATION
HE ALSO THOUGHT OF HIS MAN ##AGER ##IAL POSITION
HOW WOULD THE PAPER ##S TALK ABOUT IT
MANY LITTLE WR ##INK ##LES GATHER ##ED BETWEEN HIS EYES AS HE CONT ##EM ##PL ##ATED THIS AND HIS BR ##OW MO ##IST ##ENED
HE COULD ARR ##ANGE THAT SATISF ##ACT ##OR ##ILY FOR CAR ##RIE WOULD BE GLAD TO WAIT IF NECESSARY
HE WOULD SEE HOW THINGS TURNED OUT TO MOR ##RO ##W AND THEN HE WOULD TALK TO HER THEY WERE GOING TO MEET AS US ##UAL
FOR SOME REASON HE FELT AS IF SOMETHING MIGHT COME THAT WAY AND WAS REL ##IE ##VED WHEN ALL THE EN ##VEL ##OP ##ES HAD BEEN SC ##AN ##NED AND NOTHING SUS ##P ##IC ##IOUS NOT ##ICED
WHILE THE DANGER HAD NOT LESS ##ENED IT HAD NOT AS YET MAT ##ER ##IAL ##ISED AND WITH HIM NO NEWS WAS GOOD NEWS
SO LITTLE DID HE CONSIDER DRO ##UE ##T THAT IT NEVER ONCE OCC ##UR ##RED TO HIM TO WOR ##RY ABOUT HIS FIND ##ING OUT
HE GREW REST ##LESS AS HE RU ##M ##IN ##ATED AND THEN DEC ##IDED THAT PERHAPS IT WAS NOTHING
SHE HAD NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET AWAY THIS MORNING
HE WOULD GET ONE TO DAY IT WOULD PROB ##ABLY BE ON HIS DES ##K WHEN HE GOT BACK HE WOULD LOOK FOR IT AT ONCE
AFTER A TIME HE GAVE UP WAIT ##ING AND DR ##EAR ##ILY HEAD ##ED FOR THE MAD ##ISON CAR
HE WENT IN AND EXAM ##INED HIS LETTER ##S BUT THERE WAS NOTHING FROM CAR ##RIE
FORT ##UN ##ATELY THERE WAS NOTHING FROM HIS WIFE EITHER
AT ONE THIRTY HE WENT TO REC ##TO ##R ' S FOR LU ##N ##CH AND WHEN HE RETURNED A ME ##S ##SE ##NG ##ER WAS WAIT ##ING FOR HIM
HIS FIRST IMP ##UL ##SE WAS TO WR ##ITE BUT FOUR WORDS IN REP ##LY GO TO THE DEV ##IL
BUT HE COMP ##RO ##M ##ISED BY TELL ##ING THE BOY THAT THERE WOULD BE NO REP ##LY
THEN HE SAT DOWN IN HIS CHAIR AND G ##AZ ##ED WITHOUT SEEING CONT ##EM ##PL ##ATING THE RES ##ULT OF HIS WORK
WHAT WOULD SHE DO ABOUT THAT THE CONF ##OUNDED WR ##ET ##CH
LATER HOWEVER HIS OLD DISC ##RET ##ION ASS ##ERT ##ED ITSELF
SOMETHING HAD TO BE DONE A CL ##IM ##A ##X WAS NEAR AND SHE WOULD NOT SIT I ##DLE
HE KNEW HER WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT WHEN SHE HAD DEC ##IDED UPON A PLAN SHE WOULD FOLLOW IT UP
HE AR ##OSE FROM HIS CHAIR AND WENT AND LOOKED OUT INTO THE STREET
THE LONG DRI ##Z ##Z ##LE HAD BEG ##UN PE ##DE ##ST ##RI ##ANS HAD TURNED UP COLL ##ARS AND TR ##OUSE ##R ##S AT THE BO ##T ##TO ##M
HUR ##ST ##W ##OOD ALMOST EXCLAIMED OUT LO ##UD AT THE INS ##IST ##EN ##CY OF THIS THING
HE PUT ON HIS HAT AND LOOKED AROUND FOR HIS U ##MB ##RE ##LL ##A
HE WOULD HAVE SOME ARR ##ANGE ##MENT OF THIS THING
HE BEGAN TO WISH THAT HE HAD COMP ##RO ##M ##ISED IN SOME WAY OR OTHER THAT HE HAD SENT THE MONEY PERHAPS HE COULD DO IT UP HERE
HE WOULD GO IN AND SEE ANY ##H ##OW HE WOULD HAVE NO RO ##W
BY THE TIME HE REACHED HIS OWN STREET HE WAS KE ##EN ##LY AL ##IVE TO THE DIFFIC ##ULT ##IES OF HIS SIT ##U ##ATION AND WISH ##ED OVER AND OVER THAT SOME SOL ##UTION WOULD OFF ##ER ITSELF THAT HE COULD SEE HIS WAY OUT
THEN HE RAN ##G THE BELL NO ANSWER
HE RAN ##G AGAIN THIS TIME HARD ##ER STILL NO ANSWER
WHEN HUR ##ST ##W ##OOD GOT BACK TO HIS OFFIC ##E AGAIN HE WAS IN A GREAT ##ER QU ##AND ##ARY THAN EVER
HE COULD HARDLY REAL ##ISE HOW IT HAD ALL COME ABOUT
NO LETTER HAD COME NO WORD OF ANY KIND AND YET HERE IT WAS LATE IN THE EVENING AND SHE HAD AG ##REE ##D TO MEET HIM THAT MORNING
HE SAW THAT IN THE EXC ##ITE ##MENT OF REC ##ENT EVEN ##TS HE HAD NOT FORM ##UL ##ATED A PLAN UPON THAT SC ##ORE
HE WAS GETTING SOME V ##AG ##UE COMFORT OUT OF A GOOD C ##IG ##AR BUT IT WAS NO PA ##N ##ACE ##A FOR THE ILL WHICH AFF ##ECT ##ED HIM
IT WAS WITH GREAT OPP ##OSITION AFTER TWO OR THREE HOURS OF THE MOST U ##R ##GE ##N ##T MEN ##T ##AL AFF ##IR ##MA ##T ##ION AND DEN ##IAL THAT AT LAST HE GOT AN EN ##VEL ##OP ##E PLACED IN IT THE REQU ##ESTED AM ##OUNT AND SLOWLY SEA ##LED IT UP
THEN HE CALLED HAR ##RY THE BOY OF ALL WORK AROUND THE PLACE
YOU TAKE THIS TO THIS ADD ##RESS HE SAID HAND ##ING HIM THE EN ##VEL ##OP ##E AND GIVE IT TO MISSUS HUR ##ST ##W ##OOD YES SIR SAID THE BOY
ANY ANSWER I GU ##ESS NOT
THE BOY HAST ##ENED AWAY AND THE MAN ##AGER FELL TO HIS MUS ##INGS
HE WAS BE ##ATE ##N FOR TO NIGHT AND HE MIGHT JUST AS WELL MAKE THE BEST OF IT
SHE WOULD TAKE THE EN ##VEL ##OP ##E AND KNOW THAT SHE HAD TRI ##UMP ##H ##ED
IF HE ONLY HAD THAT LETTER BACK HE WOULD ##N ' T SEND IT
FOR REL ##IEF HE AR ##OSE AND JO ##INED IN CONVERS ##ATION WITH A FEW FRIENDS WHO WERE DRINK ##ING
ALL THE TIME HIS THOUGHTS WOULD RUN OUT TO HIS HOME AND SEE THE SC ##ENE BEING THERE ##IN EN ##ACT ##ED
IN ABOUT AN HOUR AND THREE QUAR ##TERS THE BOY RETURNED
HE FAN ##CI ##ED AS HE SAT AT HIS DES ##K THAT NOTHING WOULD BE DONE FOR A WEE ##K OR TWO MEAN ##WH ##ILE HE WOULD HAVE TIME TO THINK
HOW ABOUT THAT NOW HIS PAIN AT HER FA ##IL ##URE TO MEET OR WR ##ITE HIM RAP ##ID ##LY INC ##RE ##ASED AS HE DEV ##OTE ##D HIMSELF TO THIS SUBJECT
HE DEC ##IDED TO WR ##ITE HER CARE OF THE WE ##ST SIDE POST OFFIC ##E AND ASK FOR AN EXPL ##AN ##ATION AS WELL AS TO HAVE HER MEET HIM
THREE O ' CLOCK CAME FOUR FIVE SIX AND NO LETTER
THE HELP ##LESS MAN ##AGER PA ##CED THE FLOOR AND GR ##IM ##LY END ##URED THE GL ##OOM OF DEF ##E ##AT
HE SAW A BUS ##Y SAT ##UR ##DAY US ##HERE ##D OUT THE SA ##B ##B ##ATH IN AND NOTHING DONE
ALL DAY THE BAR BEING CLOSE ##D HE BR ##OOD ##ED ALONE SH ##UT OUT FROM HOME FROM THE EXC ##ITE ##MENT OF HIS RES ##ORT FROM CAR ##RIE AND WITHOUT THE AB ##ILITY TO AL ##TER HIS COND ##ITION ONE I ##OT ##A
IT WAS THE WOR ##ST SUN ##DAY HE HAD SPE ##N ##T IN HIS LIFE
IT SEEMED AS IF HIS FAMILY TROUBLE ##S WERE JUST BEGIN ##NING
HE WAS QUITE CERTAIN NOW THAT SHE KNEW HE WAS MAR ##RIED AND WAS ANG ##ERED AT HIS PER ##F ##ID ##Y
HE HAD LOVED HER EAR ##NE ##ST ##LY ENOUGH BUT NOW THAT THE POSS ##IB ##ILITY OF LO ##S ##ING HER ST ##ARED HIM IN THE FACE SHE SEEMED MUCH MORE ATT ##RA ##CT ##IVE
HE WOULD GO TO HER AND TELL HER ALL HIS FAMILY COMP ##LIC ##ATIONS
HE WOULD EXPL ##AIN TO HER JUST WHERE HE STOOD AND HOW MUCH HE NEED ##ED HER
HE DID MAN ##AGE TO BRING HIMSELF INTO THE MO ##OD TO GO OUT TO CAR ##RIE BUT WHEN HE GOT IN O ##G ##DEN PLACE HE THOUGHT HE SAW A MAN WATCH ##ING HIM AND WENT AWAY
HE DID NOT GO WITHIN A BL ##OCK OF THE HOUSE
HE TROUBLE ##D OVER MANY LITTLE DET ##AIL ##S AND TALK ##ED PER ##F ##UN ##CT ##OR ##ILY TO EVERY ##BODY
HE STAY ##ED AT HIS DES ##K LONG AFTER ALL OTHERS HAD GONE AND ONLY QU ##ITTED IT WHEN THE NIGHT WATCH ##MAN ON HIS ROUND PULL ##ED AT THE FRONT DOOR TO SEE IF IT WAS SA ##FE ##LY LO ##CK ##ED
ON WE ##D ##NE ##S ##DAY HE RECEIVED ANOTHER POL ##ITE NOT ##E FROM M ##C GRE ##G ##OR J ##AMES AND HA ##Y IT READ
DEAR SIR WE BEG TO INFORM YOU THAT WE ARE INST ##RU ##CTED TO WAIT UNTIL TO MOR ##RO ##W TH ##UR ##S ##DAY AT ONE O ' CLOCK BEFORE F ##ILING SU ##IT AGAINST YOU ON BEH ##AL ##F OF MISSUS J ##UL ##IA HUR ##ST ##W ##OOD FOR DIV ##OR ##CE AND AL ##IM ##ONY
VERY TR ##UL ##Y YOUR ##S E ##T CE ##TER ##A COMP ##RO ##M ##ISE
SO HERE IT WAS SPR ##EAD OUT CLEAR BEFORE HIM AND NOW HE KNEW WHAT TO EXPECT
IF HE DIDN ' T GO AND SEE THEM THEY WOULD SU ##E HIM PROM ##PT ##LY
PRE ##F ##ACE TO SECOND ED ##ITION
THIS IS A MIST ##AKE THOUGH A PERFECT ##LY NATURAL ONE
ON MY RETURN I PURPOSE ##LY AV ##O ##IDED LOOKING INTO IT UNTIL I HAD SENT BACK MY LAST REV ##ISE ##S TO THE PRIN ##TER
THEN I HAD MUCH PLEASURE IN READ ##ING IT BUT WAS INDEED SURPR ##ISED AT THE MANY LITTLE POINT ##S OF SIM ##IL ##AR ##ITY BETWEEN THE TWO BOOK ##S IN SP ##ITE OF THEIR ENTIRE INDE ##PEND ##ENCE TO ONE ANOTHER
I REG ##RET THAT REV ##IEW ##ERS HAVE IN SOME CASE ##S BEEN INCL ##INED TO TREAT THE CHAP ##TERS ON MA ##CH ##INES AS AN ATTEMPT TO RED ##U ##CE MISTER DA ##R ##W ##IN ' S THE ##ORY TO AN ABS ##UR ##D ##ITY
I AM SURPR ##ISED HOWEVER THAT THE BOOK AT WHICH SUCH AN EXAM ##PLE OF THE SPE ##CIOUS MIS ##USE OF AN ##AL ##OG ##Y WOULD SEEM MOST NATURAL ##LY LE ##VEL ##LED SHOULD HAVE OCC ##UR ##RED TO NO REV ##IEW ##ER NEITHER SHALL I MEN ##T ##ION THE NAME OF THE BOOK HERE THOUGH I SHOULD FAN ##CY THAT THE H ##INT GIVEN WILL SUFF ##ICE
BUT THIS HAD AN EFFECT OF WHICH I HAVE LITTLE REASON TO COMP ##LA ##IN FOR I WAS ALL ##OWED ALMOST TO CALL THEM LIFE LONG SELF DEC ##E ##IVER ##S TO THEIR FACE ##S AND THEY SAID IT WAS QUITE TRUE BUT THAT IT DID NOT MATTER
I MUST NOT CON ##CL ##UDE WITHOUT EXPRESS ##ING MY MOST SINCE ##RE THAN ##KS TO MY CR ##IT ##ICS AND TO THE PUBLIC FOR THE LE ##N ##IE ##N ##CY AND CONSIDER ##ATION WITH WHICH THEY HAVE TREAT ##ED MY ADV ##ENT ##URES
IT WAS WR ##ITT ##EN IN THE UP ##PER RAN ##G ##IT ##AT ##A DIST ##RIC ##T OF THE CAN ##TER ##B ##URY PROV ##INCE AS IT THEN WAS OF NEW Z ##E ##AL ##AND AND APPEARED AT CHRIST ##CH ##UR ##CH IN THE PRES ##S NEWS ##P ##APE ##R J ##UNE THIR ##TEEN ##TH EIGHTEEN SIX ##TY THREE
I ALSO WR ##OTE ABOUT THIS TIME THE SUB ##ST ##ANCE OF WHAT U ##LT ##IM ##ATELY BECAME THE MUS ##ICAL BANK ##S AND THE TRI ##AL OF A MAN FOR BEING IN A CONS ##UMP ##T ##ION
I SEE FROM MY SECOND PRE ##F ##ACE THAT I TOOK THE BOOK TO ME ##S ##S ##R ##S CHAP ##MAN AND HALL MAY FIRST EIGHTEEN SEVENT ##Y ONE AND ON THEIR RE ##JECT ##ION OF IT UNDER THE ADV ##ICE OF ONE WHO HAS ATT ##AINED THE HIGH ##EST RAN ##K AMONG LIVING WR ##ITER ##S I LET IT SLEEP TILL I TOOK IT TO MISTER TR ##UB ##NER EARLY IN EIGHTEEN SEVENT ##Y TWO
I ATT ##RIB ##UTE ITS UN ##L ##OOK ##ED FOR SUCCESS MAIN ##LY TO TWO EARLY FAV ##OURA ##BLE REV ##IEW ##S THE FIRST IN THE PAL ##L MA ##LL G ##AZ ##ET ##TE OF AP ##RI ##L TW ##EL ##FT ##H AND THE SECOND IN THE SPE ##CT ##AT ##OR OF AP ##RI ##L TW ##ENT ##IET ##H
THERE WAS ALSO ANOTHER CAUSE
THE FIRST ED ##ITION OF ER ##EW ##H ##ON SOLD IN ABOUT THREE WEE ##KS I HAD NOT TAKEN MO ##UL ##D ##S AND AS THE DEM ##AND WAS STRONG IT WAS SET UP AGAIN IMMEDIATELY
I MADE A FEW FURTHER VERY TRI ##F ##LING AL ##TER ##ATIONS BEFORE MO ##UL ##D ##S WERE TAKEN BUT SINCE THE SUM ##MER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENT ##Y TWO AS NEW ED ##ITION ##S WERE FROM TIME TO TIME WANTED THEY HAVE BEEN PRIN ##TED FROM STE ##RE ##OS THEN MADE
I AM STILL FAIR ##LY WELL SATISF ##IED WITH THOSE PART ##S OF ER ##EW ##H ##ON THAT WERE REPE ##ATED ##LY RE ##W ##RI ##T ##TEN BUT FROM THOSE THAT HAD ONLY A SING ##LE WR ##ITING I WOULD GLAD ##LY CUT OUT SOME FORT ##Y OR FIFTY PA ##GE ##S IF I COULD
THIS HOWEVER MAY NOT BE FOR THE CO ##P ##Y ##RI ##GHT WILL PROB ##ABLY EXP ##IRE IN A LITTLE OVER TW ##ELVE YEARS
IF THE READ ##ER WILL EXC ##USE ME I WILL SAY NOTHING OF MY AN ##TE ##CED ##ENTS NOR OF THE CIRCUMST ##ANCES WHICH LED ME TO LEAVE MY NAT ##IVE COUNTRY THE N ##ARR ##ATIVE WOULD BE TE ##D ##IOUS TO HIM AND PAIN ##FUL TO MYSELF
IT WILL BE SEEN THAT I DID NOT SUCC ##EE ##D IN MY DES ##IGN AND THAT HOWEVER MUCH I MAY HAVE MET WITH THAT WAS NEW AND STRANGE I HAVE BEEN UN ##ABLE TO RE ##AP ANY PE ##C ##UN ##IAR ##Y ADV ##ANT ##AGE
NO ONE WHO IS HIMSELF HON ##EST WILL DOUBT MY BEING SO
I REACHED MY DEST ##INATION IN ONE OF THE LAST MONTH ##S OF EIGHTEEN SIX ##TY EIGHT BUT I DA ##RE NOT MEN ##T ##ION THE SEA ##SON LE ##ST THE READ ##ER SHOULD GATHER IN WHICH HE ##M ##IS ##PH ##ERE I WAS
SHE ##EP AND CAT ##TLE WERE INT ##RO ##DU ##CED AND BRE ##D WITH EXT ##RE ##ME RAP ##ID ##ITY MEN TOOK UP THEIR FIFTY THOUSAND OR ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACR ##ES OF COUNTRY GOING IN ##LAND ONE BEHIND THE OTHER TILL IN A FEW YEARS THERE WAS NOT AN ACR ##E BETWEEN THE SEA AND THE FRONT RAN ##GE ##S WHICH WAS NOT TAKEN UP AND ST ##ATIONS EITHER FOR SHE ##EP OR CAT ##TLE WERE SP ##OTT ##ED ABOUT AT INTER ##VAL ##S OF SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY MILES OVER THE WHOLE COUNTRY
I WAS DELIGHT ##ED WITH THE COUNTRY AND THE MANNER OF LIFE
I WAS TO SEE THE SHE ##EP NOT NECESS ##AR ##ILY CLOSE AT HAND NOR TO GET THEM IN A SING ##LE MO ##B BUT TO SEE ENOUGH OF THEM HERE AND THERE TO FEEL EAS ##Y THAT NOTHING HAD GONE WRONG THIS WAS NO DIFFIC ##ULT MATTER FOR THERE WERE NOT ABOVE EIGHT HUNDRED OF THEM AND BEING ALL BRE ##ED ##ING E ##W ##ES THEY WERE PRETTY QUIET
THERE WERE A GOOD MANY SHE ##EP WHICH I KNEW AS TWO OR THREE BLACK E ##W ##ES AND A BLACK LA ##MB OR TWO AND SEVERAL OTHERS WHICH HAD SOME DIST ##ING ##U ##ISH ##ING MAR ##K WHERE ##BY I COULD TELL THEM
IT IS SURPR ##ISING HOW SOON THE EYE BECOME ##S ACC ##USTOM ##ED TO MISS ##ING TWENTY SHE ##EP OUT OF TWO OR THREE HUNDRED
IT WAS A MON ##OT ##ON ##OUS LIFE BUT IT WAS VERY HEA ##LT ##H ##Y AND ONE DOES NOT MUCH MIND ANYTHING WHEN ONE IS WELL
THE COUNTRY WAS THE GRAND ##EST THAT CAN BE IMAG ##INED
SO LO ##NE ##LY AND SO SOL ##EM ##N WITH THE SAD GRE ##Y CL ##OUD ##S ABOVE AND NO SOUND SAVE A LOST LA ##MB BL ##E ##ATING UPON THE MOUNTAIN SIDE AS THOUGH ITS LITTLE HEART WERE BREAK ##ING
EACH MUST CRY LO ##UDE ##R AND WA ##NDER FAR ##THER YET MAY LU ##CK BE WITH THEM BOTH THAT THEY MAY FIND THEIR OWN AT NIGHT ##F ##ALL
I HAD NO MONEY BUT IF I COULD ONLY FIND WORK ##ABLE COUNTRY I MIGHT STO ##CK IT WITH BO ##R ##RO ##W ##ED CAP ##IT ##AL AND CONSIDER MYSELF A MADE MAN
THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE WHOLE WORLD WHO HAD THE SMALL ##EST IDEA SAVE THOSE WHO WERE THEMSELVES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF IT IF INDEED THERE WAS ANY ONE AT ALL COULD I HOPE TO CROSS IT
I WOULD TRY THE NEAR ##ER RAN ##GE AND SEE HOW FAR I COULD GO
SHORT ##LY AFTER PASS ##ING ONE OF THESE CHAP ##ELS WE CAME SUDDENLY UPON A VILL ##AGE WHICH START ##ED UP OUT OF THE MIST AND I WAS AL ##AR ##MED LE ##ST I SHOULD BE MADE AN OBJECT OF CUR ##I ##OS ##ITY OR DIS ##L ##IKE
MY GU ##IDES HOWEVER WERE WELL KNOWN AND THE NATURAL POL ##ITE ##NESS OF THE PEOPLE PRE ##VENT ##ED THEM FROM PUT ##TING ME TO ANY INC ##ON ##VEN ##IENCE BUT THEY COULD NOT HELP EYE ##ING ME NOR I THEM
THE STREET ##S WERE N ##ARR ##OW AND UN ##P ##AVE ##D BUT VERY FAIR ##LY CLE ##AN
THE VI ##NE GREW OUT ##SIDE MANY OF THE HOUSE ##S AND THERE WERE SOME WITH SIGN BO ##ARDS ON WHICH WAS PAIN ##TED A BO ##T ##TLE AND A GLASS THAT MADE ME FEEL MUCH AT HOME
EVEN ON THIS LED ##GE OF HUMAN SOCI ##ETY THERE WAS A ST ##UNT ##ED GR ##OW ##TH OF SHO ##PLE ##TS WHICH HAD TAKEN RO ##OT AND VE ##GE ##T ##ATED SOME ##H ##OW THOUGH AS IN AN AIR MER ##C ##ANT ##ILE OF THE BL ##E ##AKES ##T
EACH FE ##AT ##URE WAS FIN ##ISHED EYE ##L ##ID ##S EYE ##LA ##SH ##ES AND EAR ##S BEING ALMOST INV ##AR ##IA ##B ##LY PERFECT
THEIR EXPRESS ##ION WAS DIV ##INE AND AS THEY GL ##ANCED AT ME TIM ##ID ##LY BUT WITH PART ##ED LIPS IN GREAT BE ##W ##ILD ##ER ##MENT I FORGOT ALL THOUGHTS OF THEIR CONVERS ##ION IN FEELING ##S THAT WERE FAR MORE EARTH ##LY
EVEN IN MID ##DLE AGE THEY WERE STILL COME ##LY AND THE OLD GRE ##Y HAIR ##ED WOMEN AT THEIR CO ##T ##T ##AGE DOOR ##S HAD A D ##IGN ##ITY NOT TO SAY MAJ ##EST ##Y OF THEIR OWN
THE MEN WERE AS HANDS ##OME AS THE WOMEN BEAUTIFUL
I HAVE ALWAYS DELIGHT ##ED IN AND REV ##ERE ##N ##CED BEAUTY BUT I FELT SIM ##PLY AB ##ASH ##ED IN THE PRES ##ENCE OF SUCH A SP ##LE ##ND ##ID TY ##PE A COMP ##OUND OF ALL THAT IS BEST IN E ##GY ##PT ##IAN GRE ##E ##K AND IT ##AL ##IAN
THE CHILDREN WERE INF ##IN ##ITE IN NUMBER AND EXC ##EE ##D ##INGLY MER ##RY I NEED HARDLY SAY THAT THEY CAME IN FOR THEIR FULL SHAR ##E OF THE PRE ##V ##AIL ##ING BEAUTY
I EXPRESS ##ED BY SIGN ##S MY ADM ##IR ##ATION AND PLEASURE TO MY GU ##IDES AND THEY WERE GREAT ##LY PLEASE ##D
THE COUNTRY WAS HIGH ##LY C ##ULT ##IV ##ATED EVERY LED ##GE BEING PLAN ##TED WITH CHE ##ST ##N ##UT ##S WA ##L ##N ##UT ##S AND APP ##LE TREES FROM WHICH THE APP ##LES WERE NOW GATHER ##ING
I SAW A FEW SHE ##EP WITH ROUND ##ED NO ##SE ##S AND EN ##ORM ##OUS T ##AIL ##S
IN ABOUT FOUR HOURS OF WALK ##ING FROM THE TIME WE START ##ED AND AFTER PASS ##ING TWO OR THREE MORE VILL ##AGES WE CAME UPON A CONSIDER ##ABLE TOWN AND MY GU ##IDES MADE MANY ATTEMPT ##S TO MAKE ME UNDERSTAND SOMETHING BUT I GATHER ##ED NO IN ##K ##LING OF THEIR MEAN ##ING EXCEPT THAT I NEED BE UNDER NO APP ##RE ##H ##ENS ##ION OF DANGER
SUFF ##ICE IT THAT I FOUND MYSELF TAKEN BEFORE THE CHIEF MAG ##IST ##RA ##TE AND BY HIS ORDER ##S WAS PLACED IN AN AP ##ART ##MENT WITH TWO OTHER PEOPLE WHO WERE THE FIRST I HAD SEEN LOOKING ANYTHING BUT WELL AND HANDS ##OME
IN FACT ONE OF THEM WAS PLAIN ##LY VERY MUCH OUT OF HEA ##LT ##H AND CO ##UG ##H ##ED VI ##OL ##ENTLY FROM TIME TO TIME IN SP ##ITE OF MAN ##IFE ##ST EFF ##ORT ##S TO SUPP ##RESS IT
THE OTHER LOOKED PAL ##E AND ILL BUT HE WAS MAR ##VEL ##L ##OUSLY SELF CONT ##AINED AND IT WAS IMPOSS ##IBLE TO SAY WHAT WAS THE MATTER WITH HIM
THEY FELT MY P ##UL ##SE THEY LOOKED AT MY TO ##NG ##UE THEY LIST ##ENED AT MY CHE ##ST THEY FELT ALL MY MUS ##CL ##ES AND AT THE END OF EACH OP ##ER ##ATION THEY LOOKED AT THE CHIEF AND NO ##D ##DE ##D AND SAID SOMETHING IN A TONE QUITE PLEAS ##ANT AS THOUGH I WERE ALL RIGHT
BUT BY AND BY THEY CAME TO MY WATCH WHICH I HAD H ##ID ##DEN AWAY IN THE IN ##MOST POCK ##ET THAT I HAD AND HAD FORGOT ##TEN WHEN THEY BEGAN THEIR SEA ##R ##CH
AGAIN THERE WAS A VERY OLD CAR ##RIAGE WHOSE WH ##EE ##LS IN SP ##ITE OF RU ##ST AND DEC ##AY I COULD SEE HAD BEEN DES ##IGN ##ED OR ##IG ##IN ##ALLY FOR IR ##ON RA ##ILS
WE PASSED MANY CASE ##S AND AT LAST CAME TO ONE IN WHICH THERE WERE SEVERAL CLOCK ##S AND TWO OR THREE OLD WATCH ##ES
THE DES ##IGN WAS DIFFERENT BUT THE THING WAS CLEAR ##LY THE SAME
THIS HAD SOME EFFECT IN CAL ##MING HIM
HE BEGAN PRESENT ##LY TO REL ##ENT AND SPOKE TO ME IN A KIND ##ER MANNER
I IMAG ##INE THERE WERE SEVERAL KIND ##S OF OLD FA ##SH ##ION ##ED CHRIST ##MA ##SE ##S BUT IT COULD HARDLY BE WOR ##SE THAN A CH ##OP IN MY CH ##AM ##BER ##S OR HOR ##RO ##R OF HOR ##RO ##R ##S AT THE CL ##UB OR MY CO ##US ##IN LU ##CY ' S NOT ##ION OF WHAT SHE CALL ##S THE FE ##ST ##IVE SEA ##SON
FE ##ST ##IVE YES
THE REP ##LY WAS WR ##ITT ##EN IN A SPR ##AW ##LING FE ##M ##IN ##INE HAND IT WAS A LITTLE V ##AG ##UE
IT APPEARED THAT THE TER ##MS WOULD BE FIVE GU ##INE ##AS BUT THERE WAS NO MEN ##T ##ION OF THE LENGTH OF TIME WHICH THAT FE ##E WOULD COVER
THE WHOLE THING WAS A TRI ##F ##LE O ##D ##D
THERE WAS NOTHING SAID ABOUT THE SORT OF ACCOM ##M ##OD ##ATION WHICH WOULD BE PROV ##IDED NOTHING ABOUT THE KIND OF EST ##AB ##LISH ##MENT WHICH WAS MAIN ##TAINED OR THE TABLE WHICH WAS KEPT
NOW IT IS A REMARK ##ABLE THING THAT I HAVE ALWAYS HAD AN EXT ##RA ##ORD ##INARY PRE ##D ##ILE ##CTION FOR THE NAME MAD ##GE I DO NOT KNOW WHY
I HAVE NEVER KNOWN A MAD ##GE AND YET FROM MY BOY ##HOOD UP ##WARD I HAVE DESIRE ##D TO MEET ONE
UNDER SUCH CIRCUMST ##ANCES SHE WAS HARDLY LIKE ##LY TO BE LIVE ##LY HERSELF BUT HER NAME WAS MAD ##GE AND IT WAS THE ACC ##IDENT OF HER CHRIST ##IAN NAME WHICH DEC ##IDED ME TO GO
I HAD NO ILL ##USION ##S
I DID NOT EXPECT A PRINCE ##LY ENTER ##TAIN ##MENT
ALL NIGHT IT HAD BEEN BL ##OWING AND RA ##INING
I FELT QUITE LIVE ##LY MYSELF AS I MIN ##G ##LED WITH THE CHRIST ##MA ##S CROWD LOOKING FOR THINGS WHICH MIGHT NOT TURN OUT TO BE ABS ##OL ##UTE ##LY PREP ##OST ##ER ##OUS
I EVEN BO ##UGHT SOMETHING FOR MAD ##GE I MEAN MISSUS W ##ILS ##ON
IT WAS A HOR ##RIB ##LE JOUR ##NEY
HE WAS IMP ##ER ##V ##IOUS TO REASON
IT IS SOME SATISF ##ACT ##ION FOR ME TO BE ABLE TO REF ##LE ##CT THAT I MADE IT WARM FOR THE OFFIC ##IAL ##S HOWEVER COLD I MIGHT HAVE BEEN MYSELF
WHEN AT LAST I REACHED CR ##O ##FT ##ON MY JOUR ##NEY ' S END IT TURNED OUT THAT THE ST ##ATION ST ##A ##FF CONS ##IST ##ED OF A HALF W ##ITTED IND ##IV ##ID ##UAL WHO WAS ST ##ATION ##MA ##STER PORT ##ER AND CLE ##R ##K COM ##B ##INED AND A H ##UL ##KING LAD WHO DID WHATEVER ELSE THERE WAS TO DO
NO ONE HAD COME TO MEET ME THE VILL ##AGE WAS ABOUT HALF A MIL ##E AND HA ##NG ##AR DEN ##E THE HOUSE FOR WHICH MY STEP ##S WERE BE ##N ##T ABOUT FOUR MILES BY THE ROAD HOW FAR IT WAS ACROSS PL ##OUGH ##ED FIELD ##S MY INFORM ##ANT DID NOT MEN ##T ##ION
THERE WAS A TRA ##P AT THE BOY AND BL ##UND ##ER ##B ##USS BUT THAT REQU ##IRED FE ##T ##CHING
WHEN THE TRA ##P DID APPEAR IT LOOKED TO ME UNC ##OM ##M ##ON ##LY LIKE AN OPEN SPR ##ING CAR ##T
IN IT I WAS DEP ##OS ##ITED WITH MY LU ##GG ##AGE
I DID NOT KNOW WHAT HE MEANT
I DID NOT ASK I WAS BEYOND IT
I WAS CH ##ILLED TO THE BO ##NE WE ##T T ##IRED HUNG ##RY
I HAD LONG BEEN WISH ##ING THAT AN OLD FA ##SH ##ION ##ED CHRIST ##MA ##S HAD BEEN COMPLE ##TE ##LY EXT ##INCT BEFORE I HAD THOUGHT OF ADV ##ENT ##URING IN QUEST OF ONE
HERE WE BE THAT MIGHT BE SO
THERE BE THE DOOR IN FRONT OF YOU YOU GO UP THREE STEP ##S IF YOU CAN FIND EM
THERE ' S A KN ##OCK ##ER IF NONE OF EM HAVE ##N ' T TW ##IST ##ED IT OFF
THERE APPEARED TO BE NO KN ##OCK ##ER THOUGH WHETHER IT HAD BEEN TW ##IST ##ED OFF WAS MORE THAN I COULD SAY
NO ANSWER THOUGH I ALL ##OWED A MORE THAN DEC ##ENT INTER ##VAL
BETTER R ##ING AGAIN SUGG ##ESTED THE DRI ##VER HARD
MAY ##BE THEY ' RE UP TO SOME OF THEIR G ##AMES AND WANT ##S RO ##US ##ING
THE BELL REV ##ER ##BER ##ATED THROUGH WHAT SEEMED LIKE AN EM ##PT ##Y HOUSE
PRESENT ##LY FEET WERE HEARD ADV ##AN ##CING ALONG THE PASS ##AGE SEVERAL PA ##IR ##S IT SEEMED AND A LIGHT GL ##E ##AMED THROUGH THE WINDOW OVER THE DOOR
A VOICE INQU ##IRED WHO ' S THERE
THE INFORM ##ATION WAS GRE ##ET ##ED WITH WHAT SOUND ##ED UNC ##OM ##M ##ON ##LY LIKE A CH ##OR ##US OF LAUGH ##TER
THERE WAS A RU ##SH OF RET ##REAT ##ING FEET AN EXP ##OST ##UL ##ATING VOICE THEN DARK ##NESS AGAIN AND SILENCE
WHO LIVE ##S HERE ARE THE PEOPLE MAD
I TO ##LLED THE BELL AGAIN
AFTER A V ##AST AM ##OUNT OF UN ##F ##AST ##ENING THE DOOR WAS OPENED AND ON THE THR ##ESH ##OLD THERE STOOD A GIRL WITH A LIGHT ##ED CAN ##DLE IN HER HAND
I ' M MISTER CHRIST ##OP ##HER FROM LONDON
WE ' VE LOST THE KE ##Y OF THE CE ##LL ##AR AND THERE ' S NOTHING OUT EXCEPT WATER AND I DON ' T THINK YOU ' D CARE FOR THAT
HER FATHER IS A MOST REMARK ##ABLE PERSON TO SAY THE LEAST
BUT IT IS QUITE PLAIN TO ME THAT ALL THE ARR ##ANGE ##MENTS FOR MY WE ##D ##D ##ING ARE GOING TO BE MADE BY THE SN ##ELL ##INGS
I DO NOT KNOW WHEN IT IS GOING TO BE BUT IT WILL BE EITHER NEXT WEE ##K OR THE WEE ##K AFTER CERTAINLY AT THE EAR ##L ##IEST POSSIBLE MOMENT AND I SHOULD ##N ' T BE AT ALL SURPR ##ISED TO LEAR ##N THAT ALL MARY ANN ' S THINGS HAD BEEN ALREADY BO ##UGHT AND PERHAPS SOME OF THEM MAR ##KED
IT IS MOST DELIGHT ##FUL
IT MIGHT JUST AS WELL BE SOME ONE ELSE ' S WE ##D ##D ##ING SO UN ##IM ##P ##ORT ##ANT IS THE PART WHICH I AM SET TO PLAY IN IT
FOR INST ##ANCE LOOK AT THEIR BEH ##AV ##I ##OUR IN THE MATTER OF THE R ##ING
THE ACC ##IDENT IN QUESTION OCC ##UR ##RED UPON THE SUN ##DAY EVENING
THE GIRL IS FRE ##T ##TING BUT YOU DON ' T SEEM TO NOT ##ICE IT
I G ##ASP ##ED PO ##S ##IT ##IVE ##LY G ##ASP ##ED
THAT ' S IT ON YOUR ACCOUNT
FROM A CO ##US ##IN OF OUR ##S WHO ' S IN THAT LINE
I NEVER SAW PEOPLE LIKE THE SN ##ELL ##INGS FOR POSS ##ESS ##ING REL ##ATIVE ##S IN ALL SORT ##S OF LINE ##S
I WAS PERS ##U ##ADE ##D THAT SOME ##BODY BESIDES THAT CO ##US ##IN GOT A PROF ##IT OUT OF MARY ANN ' S ENG ##AGE ##MENT R ##ING BUT I HAND ##ED OVER THE AM ##OUNT
IT IS FROM HER ACT ##ION IN THAT MATTER THAT MY SUS ##P ##IC ##ION SPR ##INGS
THERE SHE OWN ##S A CO ##T ##T ##AGE OR IT MAY BE A P ##IG ##ST ##Y ##E FOR ALL I KNOW
WHEN SHE HEARD OF MY ENG ##AGE ##MENT WITH MARY ANN SHE WR ##OTE AND SUGG ##ESTED THAT WE SHOULD SPE ##ND OUR HON ##EY ##M ##OON IN HER CO ##T ##T ##AGE OR P ##IG ##ST ##Y ##E AND THAT I SHOULD PAY HER RE ##N ##T FOR IT
THERE WERE NO SIGN ##S OF FA ##LT ##ERING ABOUT HER FLO ##W OF LA ##NG ##U ##AGE
I FOUND THAT AS A WOMAN OF BUSINESS SHE WAS BEYOND ALL MY EXPECT ##ATIONS
IT TURNED OUT THAT SHE HAD A LITTLE MONEY OF HER OWN ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY PO ##UND ##S A YEAR
AND OF COURSE I HAD MY EXPECT ##ATIONS AND SHE HAD HER ##S
IT WAS PLAIN THAT TOGETHER WE SHOULD MAN ##AGE MOST COMFORT ##ABLY DELIGHT ##FULLY IN FACT
I SHALL MAKE PAP ##A GIVE ME FIVE HUNDRED PO ##UND ##S AT LEAST
A BIRD IN THE HAND IS WORTH TWO IN A BUS ##H ' AND IT WILL BE SOMETHING TO HAVE BY US
I KNOW WHAT MA ##M ##MA CAN AFF ##ORD TO GIVE AND I WILL SEE SHE GIVE ##S IT
AND I WILL SEE THAT THERE IS NO SH ##IR ##KING ABOUT THE BOYS OR ABOUT THE GIRLS EITHER
I HAVE DRAW ##N UP A LIST OF ALL THE PEOPLE WHO OUGHT TO GIVE US A PRESENT AND I SHALL TELL THEM WHAT THEY OUGHT TO GIVE IT WON ' T BE MY FA ##ULT IF I DON ' T GET IT
OF COURSE THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WITH WHOM YOU CAN ' T BE PERFECT ##LY PLAIN BUT I SHALL BE AS PLAIN AS I CAN THERE ' S A WAY AND A MANNER OF DOING THAT KIND OF THING
HER ##S HAS BEEN PRO ##D ##IG ##IOUS
SHE HAS A KN ##ACK OF GETTING PEOPLE TO DO WHAT SHE WISH ##ES AND TO GIVE HER WHAT SHE WANT ##S WHICH IS A LITTLE SHORT OF M ##IR ##AC ##UL ##OUS
I NOT ##ICE THAT THEY ARE GENERAL ##LY PERSON ##S WHO HAVE ALREADY TEN ##DER ##ED THEIR OFF ##ERING ##S
THE FACT OF HAVING GIVEN MARY ANN A WE ##D ##D ##ING PRESENT SEEMS TO F ##ILL THEM WITH A FEELING OF RAN ##CO ##RO ##US AC ##ID ##ITY WHICH TO ME IS IN ##E ##X ##PL ##IC ##ABLE
SUCH IS THE SELF ##ISH ##NESS OF HUMAN NATURE
BUT WHY ON THAT ACCOUNT THEY SHOULD P ##ITY ME I AL ##TO ##GETHER FA ##IL TO UNDERSTAND
WE HAVE ALL BEEN GI ##VING MARY ANN PRESENT ##S AND I SUPPOSE YOU MISTER WH ##ITING HAVE BEEN GI ##VING HER SOMETHING TOO
THAT WAS WHAT MISSUS MA ##C ##PH ##ERS ##ON SAID TO ME ONLY THE OTHER DAY
AND WHAT INQU ##IRED MISSUS MA ##C ##PH ##ERS ##ON HAS MARY ANN GIVEN YOU HER LOVE
SOME ##ONE SN ##IG ##GER ##ED
I CANNOT PRET ##END TO EXPL ##AIN WHY EXCEPT ON THE SUPP ##OSITION THAT ROM ##ANCE IS DEAD AT LEAST IN THAT CIRC ##LE OF SOCI ##ETY IN WHICH THE SN ##ELL ##INGS MOVE
AS IT IS UN ##LESS I AM MIST ##AKEN SOME OF THE RE ##ND ##ING WILL BE ON OUR SIDE AND THEY KNOW IT
P S THE CAR ##D ##S ARE OUT FOR THE WE ##D ##D ##ING
WE ARE GOING FOR OUR HON ##EY ##M ##OON TO IT ##AL ##Y AND THE SOUTH OF FR ##ANCE
A SECOND CO ##US ##IN OF MARY ANN ' S IS IN THE CO ##OK ' S TOU ##R ##S LINE
HE HAS GIVEN US FREE PASS ##ES ALL THE WAY TO THE END OF OUR JOUR ##NEY AND ALL THE WAY BACK AGAIN AND CO ##UP ##ONS FOR FREE BO ##ARD AND LO ##D ##GING AT THE HOT ##EL IT ' S A WE ##D ##D ##ING PRESENT
BESIDES WHICH WE CAN ALWAYS SE ##LL THE CO ##UP ##ONS AND RA ##IL ##WAY PASS ##ES WHICH WE DON ' T USE
HE WAS YOUNG NO SPE ##AR HAD TOU ##CHED HIM NO PO ##ISON LU ##R ##KED IN HIS WIN ##E
I TELL YOU IT IS NOT PO ##ISON SHE CRIED
SINCE HIS B ##IRT ##H HE HAS BEEN GU ##ARD ##ED SO CLOSE ##LY THAT THE CLE ##VER ##EST PO ##ISON ##ERS OF THE EAS ##T COULD NOT REACH HIM
AS YOU WELL KNOW THERE ARE TEN MEN AND TEN WOMEN WHOSE SOL ##E DUT ##Y IS TO T ##AST ##E HIS FOOD AND WIN ##E AND FIFTY ARM ##ED WAR ##RI ##ORS GU ##ARD HIS CH ##AM ##BER AS THEY GU ##ARD IT NOW
A LOW CONF ##USED MO ##AN WA ##NED FROM HIS MOUTH
THE MAN SH ##RU ##GG ##ED HIS BR ##O ##AD SHOULD ##ERS AND TURNED BACK INTO THE AR ##AB ##ES ##QU ##E CH ##AM ##BER
THIS MAN WAS CL ##AD IN A BROWN CAME ##L HAIR ROB ##E AND SA ##ND ##ALS AND A GREEN T ##UR ##B ##AN WAS ON HIS HEAD
NOT UNTIL THE HEAVEN ##S WERE IN THE PROPER ORDER COULD THEY PER ##FORM THIS NE ##C ##RO ##MAN ##CY
WITH A LONG ST ##AINED FING ##ERN ##AIL HE MA ##PPED THE CONST ##ELL ##ATIONS ON THE MAR ##BLE T ##ILED FLOOR
THE SLA ##N ##T OF THE MOON PRES ##AGED EV ##IL FOR THE KING OF VE ##ND ##H ##Y ##A THE ST ##ARS ARE IN T ##UR ##M ##O ##IL THE SER ##PE ##N ##T IN THE HOUSE OF THE ELE ##PH ##ANT

BUT AT THE U ##R ##GE ##N ##T ENT ##REAT ##Y OF THE PRINCESS OF K ##H ##OS ##AL ##A WHO LOVED B ##H ##UND ##A CH ##AND V ##AIN ##LY HE GAVE HER A LO ##CK OF HIS LONG BLACK HAIR AS A TO ##KE ##N OF REM ##EM ##BR ##ANCE
BY WHICH A SOUL IS DRAW ##N FROM ITS BODY AND ACROSS GU ##LF ##S OF E ##CH ##O ##ING SP ##ACE RETURNED THE MAN ON THE MAT
ON THE DA ##IS UNDER THE GOLD ##EN DO ##ME THE KING CRIED OUT AGAIN RA ##CK ##ED BY AW ##FUL PAR ##O ##X ##YS ##MS
THEY SEE ##K TO SN ##AP THE SIL ##VER COR ##D THAT B ##IND ##S ME TO MY D ##YING BODY
THEY CL ##UST ##ER AROUND ME THEIR HANDS ARE T ##AL ##ONE ##D THEIR EYES ARE RED LIKE FL ##AME BURN ##ING IN DARK ##NESS
THEIR FING ##ERS SEA ##R ME LIKE FIRE
I KNOW NOW WHAT BRING ##S ME TO THE P ##Y ##RE
THERE THEY STR ##OVE TO BREAK THE SIL ##VER COR ##D OF LIFE AND THR ##UST MY SOUL INTO THE BODY OF A FO ##UL NIGHT WE ##IRD THEIR SO ##R ##CER ##Y SUM ##M ##ONE ##D UP FROM HEL ##L AH
YOUR CRY AND THE GR ##IP OF YOUR FING ##ERS BROUGHT ME BACK BUT I AM GOING FAST
THERE WAS THE OLD IMP ##ER ##IOUS NOT ##E IN HIS FA ##ILING WHIS ##PER
YOU HAVE NEVER DIS ##O ##BE ##Y ##ED ME OB ##EY MY LAST COMMAND
SEND MY SOUL CLE ##AN TO AS ##UR ##A
THEY ALSO FOUND A MAR ##T ##IAN CAL ##END ##AR THE YEAR HAD BEEN DIV ##IDED INTO TEN MORE OR LESS EQU ##AL MONTH ##S AND ONE OF THEM HAD BEEN DO ##MA

THE C ##IV ##IL ##IAN SPE ##CI ##AL ##ISTS IN OTHER FIELD ##S AND THE SP ##ACE FORCE PEOPLE WHO HAD BEEN HOLD ##ING T ##APE LINE ##S AND MAKING SK ##ET ##CHES AND SN ##APP ##ING CAME ##RA ##S WERE ALL FL ##YING TO LOW ##ER SY ##R ##T ##IS TO FIND OUT HOW MUCH O ##X ##Y ##GE ##N THERE WAS AND WHAT KIND OF LIFE IT SUPP ##ORT ##ED
THEY HAD FOUR OR FIVE SPE ##CI ##ES OF WHAT MIGHT LO ##OSE ##LY BE CALLED BIRD ##S AND SOMETHING THAT COULD EAS ##ILY BE CLASS ##ED AS A REP ##T ##ILE AND A CAR ##N ##IV ##OR ##OUS MA ##M ##MA ##L THE S ##IZE OF A CAT WITH BIRD ##L ##IKE CL ##AW ##S AND A HER ##B ##IV ##ORE ALMOST IDE ##N ##T ##ICAL WITH THE P ##IG ##L ##IKE THING IN THE BIG DA ##R ##F ##H ##UL ##V ##A MUR ##AL AND ANOTHER LIKE A G ##AZ ##ELL ##E WITH A SING ##LE HOR ##N IN THE MID ##DLE OF ITS FORE ##H ##EAD

I ASKED AS SOON AS GE ##OR ##GE HAD RETURNED TO MY SIDE
HE WANT ##S ME TO STAND READY TO OB ##EY ANY SUM ##M ##ONS THE POL ##ICE MAY SEND ME
I EM ##PH ##AS ##ISED COMP ##LA ##CE ##N ##T ##LY
HE APPEARED TO KNOW FOR HE TOLD ME AT ONCE THAT HE WAS DET ##ECT ##IVE GR ##Y ##CE A MAN WHO HAD GR ##OWN OLD IN SOL ##VING JUST SUCH B ##A ##FF ##LING PROB ##LE ##MS AS THESE
HE GAVE UP WORK SOME TIME AGO I HAVE BEEN TOLD MY HUSBAND WENT ON BUT EV ##IDENT ##LY A GREAT CASE STILL HAS ITS ALL ##URE ##MENT FOR HIM
THE TRA ##IL HERE MUST BE A VERY BL ##IND ONE FOR THEM TO CALL HIM IN
I WISH WE HAD NOT LEFT SO SOON
HE WAS LATE OF COURSE BUT WHEN HE DID APPEAR I ALMOST FORGOT OUR US ##UAL GRE ##ET ##ING IN MY HUR ##RY TO ASK HIM IF HE HAD SEEN THE EVENING PAPER ##S
HOWEVER A LITTLE LATER WE HAD A COMFORT ##ABLE CH ##AT
IT WAS ONE WHICH GAVE ME A SMALL TRI ##UMP ##H OVER GE ##OR ##GE
THE SUGG ##EST ##ION HE HAD LAUGH ##ED AT WAS NOT SO ENTIRE ##LY FOOL ##ISH AS HE HAD BEEN PLEASE ##D TO CONSIDER IT
THEIR GRE ##ET ##ING WAS COR ##D ##IAL AND THE LINE ##S ON THE LA ##T ##TER ' S FACE REL ##A ##X ##ED A LITTLE AS HE MET THE STILL BRIGHT EYE OF THE MAN UPON WHOSE INST ##INCT AND JUD ##G ##MENT SO MUCH REL ##IAN ##CE HAD ALWAYS BEEN PLACED
THIS IS VERY GOOD OF YOU HE BEGAN GL ##AN ##CING DOWN AT THE AGE ##D DET ##ECT ##IVE ' S BU ##ND ##LED UP LEG ##S AND GENT ##LY P ##USH ##ING A CHAIR TOWARDS HIM
IT ' S THE MOST IN ##E ##X ##PL ##IC ##ABLE THERE
BUT CLE ##W ##S THERE ARE ABS ##OL ##UTE ##LY NONE
THAT IS WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO FIND ANY PERHAPS YOU CAN
AT LEAST THAT IS WHAT WE HOPE
IT ' S A CASE IN A THOUSAND GR ##Y ##CE
THE OLD MAN ' S EYES SHO ##T FIRE AND UNC ##ONS ##CIOUS ##LY ONE FOOT SL ##IP ##PE ##D TO THE FLOOR
SHE HAD NO COMPAN ##ION NEAR HER
NO WORD NO CRY JUST A COLL ##APS ##E AND SUDDEN FALL
IN OLD ##EN DAYS THEY WOULD HAVE SAID STRUCK BY A BO ##LT FROM HEAVEN
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF IT GR ##Y ##CE
I SHOULD LIKE TO SEE THE DES ##K YOU SPEAK OF AND THE SP ##OT WHERE SHE FELL
A YOUNG FELLOW WHO HAD BEEN HO ##VER ##ING IN THE BACK ##GR ##OUND AT ONCE STEP ##PE ##D FORWARD
HE WAS THE PLAIN FACE ##D DET ##ECT ##IVE WHO HAD SPOKE ##N TO GE ##OR ##GE
THIS SWEET ##W ##ATER AS THEY CALLED HIM WAS I HAVE SINCE UNDERST ##OOD ONE OF HIS PROT ##E ##GE ##S AND MORE OR LESS OF A FAV ##OUR ##ITE
BEEN OVER THE GROUND STUD ##IED THE AFF ##AIR CARE ##FULLY
VERY WELL THEN YOU ' RE IN A POSITION TO P ##ION ##EE ##R ME
WELL WELL THAT ' S HON ##EST AT ALL EVEN ##TS
BUT I ' M IN NO POSITION TO MAKE PROM ##ISE ##S
OLD DAYS DON ' T RETURN FOR THE ASK ##ING
WHETHER HE GOT ANYTHING ELSE IT WOULD BE IMPOSS ##IBLE TO SAY FROM HIS MANNER AS HE FIN ##ALLY SA ##N ##K INTO A CHAIR BY ONE OF THE OPEN ##INGS AND LOOKED DOWN ON THE LO ##B ##BY BEL ##OW
ONE OR TWO OF THE MUS ##IC ##IANS FROM THE END OF THE HALL
NATURAL ##LY THEY REACHED HER FIRST
MAR ##K SO ##W ##ER ##BY AND CL ##AU ##S HEN ##NER ##BER ##G
HON ##EST GE ##R ##MAN ##S MEN WHO HAVE PLAY ##ED HERE FOR YEARS
WHO CAME NEXT ON THE SC ##ENE SOME PEOPLE FROM THE LO ##B ##BY
ANY ##BODY BEFORE THE FATHER CAME IN
YES MISS CL ##ARK ##E THE MID ##DLE AGE ##D LADY WITH THE PAR ##RI ##SH ##ES
I SUPPOSE SHE HAS BEEN CARE ##FULLY QUESTION ##ED VERY I SHOULD SAY
AND SHE SPEAK ##S OF NO WE ##AP ##ON
NOT TILL THE DOCTOR CAME HER DOCTOR WHO WAS HAPP ##ILY IN HIS OFFIC ##E IN THIS VERY BUILD ##ING
YES MISTER SLA ##TER THE ASS ##IST ##ANT MAN ##AGER WHO WAS IN THE LO ##B ##BY AT THE TIME SAYS THAT TEN MINUTES AT LEAST MUST HAVE EL ##APS ##ED
NO DOUBT
SWEET ##W ##ATER SOME ##ONE DREW THAT WE ##AP ##ON OUT
NOT AL ##TO ##GETHER BY ME
WHERE ##VER SHE PLEASE ##S ONLY I CAN ' T WALK FAR
IT HAS NOT BEEN RUN ##NING SINCE LAST NIGHT OR IT WOULD BE FULL OF CUR ##IOUS PEOPLE ALL THE TIME HUS ##T ##LING TO GET A GL ##IM ##PS ##E OF THIS PLACE
BUT THEY ' LL PUT A MAN ON FOR YOU
VERY GOOD MAN ##AGE IT AS YOU WILL
I ' LL WAIT HERE TILL YOU ' RE READY EXPL ##AIN YOURSELF TO THE LADY TELL HER I ' M AN OLD AND R ##H ##E ##UM ##AT ##IC INV ##AL ##ID WHO HAS BEEN USED TO ASK ##ING HIS OWN QUESTION ##S
AS HER QUIET FIG ##URE APPEARED IN THE DOOR ##WAY SWEET ##W ##ATER STO ##LE A GL ##ANCE AT MISTER GR ##Y ##CE
THERE WAS NO DOUBT ##ING THEM IN THIS INST ##ANCE
YES
FOR SOME LITTLE TIME THAT IS IT SEEMED LONG THOUGH I BELIEVE IT WAS NOT MORE THAN A MIN ##UTE BEFORE TWO MEN CAME RUN ##NING FROM THE MUS ##IC ##IANS G ##ALL ##ERY
YES MANY TIMES
WHAT MADE THE DIFFER ##ENCE
MISS CL ##ARK ##E START ##ED AND HER SWEET FACE SHOW ##ED A MOMENT ' S PER ##PLE ##X ##ITY DID I SHE QU ##ER ##IED MUS ##INGLY
NO A VERY NATURAL ONE I SHOULD SAY
AND THE GL ##ANCE SHE CAST HIM WHILE NOT MEET ##ING HIS EYE SHOW ##ED THAT SHE UNDERST ##OOD THE IMPORT ##ANCE OF THE ADM ##ISS ##ION
I KNOW SHE SAID WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO ASK ME NOW
THERE WAS NO PO ##N ##IAR ##D IN THE WO ##UND
THE TIME IS N ##ARR ##OWED DOWN TO ONE AND IN THAT ONE MISS CL ##ARK ##E WAS THE ONLY PERSON TO TOU ##CH HER
I WILL TROUBLE YOU NO FURTHER
SWEET ##W ##ATER HELP ME OUT OF THIS
BUT VI ##G ##OUR RETURNED TO HIM BEFORE HE HAD WELL REACHED THE DOOR AND HE SHOW ##ED SOME OF HIS OLD SPIRIT AS HE THAN ##KED MISS CL ##ARK ##E AND TURNED TO TAKE THE ELE ##V ##AT ##OR
THE NEXT MIN ##UTE SHE WAS IN THIS LADY ' S ARMS
NO WE ##AP ##ON PROT ##RU ##DE ##D FROM THE WO ##UND NOR WAS ANY FOUND ON OR NEAR HER IN THE ME ##Z ##Z ##AN ##INE WHAT FOLLOW ##S
SHE STRUCK THE BL ##OW HERSELF AND THE STRENGTH OF PURPOSE WHICH LED HER TO DO THIS GAVE HER THE ADD ##ITION ##AL FORCE TO PULL THE WE ##AP ##ON OUT AND FL ##ING IT FROM HER
IT DID NOT FALL UPON THE FLOOR AROUND HER THEREFORE IT FLE ##W THROUGH ONE OF THOSE OPEN ##INGS INTO THE LO ##B ##BY AND THERE IT EITHER WILL BE OR HAS BEEN FOUND
WITH AN ED ##U ##C ##ATION WHICH OUGHT TO HAVE EN ##S ##URED ME AN HON ##OURA ##BLE STANDING IN THE WORLD WITH SOME INTELL ##IG ##ENCE W ##IT GOOD LI ##TER ##ARY AND SC ##IENT ##IFIC KNOWLEDGE AND END ##OWED WITH THOSE ACC ##IDENT ##AL PH ##YS ##ICAL QU ##AL ##ITIES WHICH ARE SUCH A GOOD PASS ##P ##ORT INTO SOCI ##ETY I FOUND MYSELF AT THE AGE OF TWENTY THE MEAN FOLLOW ##ER OF A SUB ##L ##IME ART IN WHICH IF GREAT T ##ALE ##N ##T IS RIGHT ##LY ADM ##IRED MED ##I ##OC ##RI ##TY IS AS RIGHT ##LY DESP ##ISED
I WAS COMP ##ELL ##ED BY PO ##VER ##TY TO BECOME A MEM ##BER OF A MUS ##ICAL B ##AND IN WHICH I COULD EXPECT NEITHER EST ##EE ##M NOR CONSIDER ##ATION AND I WAS WELL AW ##ARE THAT I SHOULD BE THE LAUGH ##ING STO ##CK OF THE PERSON ##S WHO HAD KNOWN ME AS A DOCTOR IN DIV ##IN ##ITY AS AN E ##CC ##LES ##IA ##ST ##IC AND AS AN OFFIC ##ER IN THE ARM ##Y AND HAD WE ##L ##CO ##MED ME IN THE HIGH ##EST SOCI ##ETY
I FELT THAT IN MY FIRST PROF ##ESSION AS I WAS NOT BL ##ESSED WITH THE VO ##C ##ATION NECESSARY TO IT I SHOULD HAVE SUCC ##EE ##DE ##D ONLY BY DIN ##T OF H ##Y ##P ##OC ##RI ##S ##Y AND I SHOULD HAVE BEEN DESP ##IC ##ABLE IN MY OWN EST ##IM ##ATION EVEN IF I HAD SEEN THE PURP ##LE MAN ##TLE ON MY SHOULD ##ERS FOR THE GREAT ##EST D ##IGN ##ITIES CANNOT SILENCE A MAN ' S OWN CONS ##CI ##ENCE
BESIDES I WAS OF OPIN ##ION THAT A MAN ' S PROF ##ESSION WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE OUGHT TO SUPP ##LY HIM WITH ENOUGH MONEY TO SATISF ##Y ALL HIS WANT ##S AND THE VERY POOR PAY OF AN OFFIC ##ER WOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN SUFF ##IC ##IENT TO COVER MY EXP ##ENSE ##S BECAUSE MY ED ##U ##C ##ATION HAD GIVEN ME GREAT ##ER WANT ##S THAN THOSE OF OFFIC ##ERS IN GENERAL
OUR SC ##AND ##AL ##OUS PRO ##CEED ##INGS OFTEN EXP ##OSED US TO THE GREAT ##EST DANGER
WE WOULD VERY OFTEN SPE ##ND THE WHOLE NIGHT RA ##MB ##LING ABOUT THE CITY INV ##ENT ##ING AND CARRY ##ING INTO EX ##E ##C ##UTION THE MOST IMP ##ERT ##INE ##N ##T PRACT ##ICAL JO ##KE ##S
WE DID THE SAME WITH PH ##YS ##IC ##IANS WHOM WE OFTEN SENT HALF DRESS ##ED TO SOME NO ##BLE ##MAN WHO WAS ENJ ##OY ##ING EXC ##ELL ##ENT HEA ##LT ##H
WHEN ##EVER WE COULD CONTR ##IVE TO GET INTO A CHURCH TO ##W ##ER WE THOUGHT IT GREAT F ##UN TO FRIGHT ##EN ALL THE PAR ##ISH BY R ##ING ##ING THE AL ##AR ##M BELL AS IF SOME FIRE HAD BR ##OKEN OUT BUT THAT WAS NOT ALL WE ALWAYS CUT THE BELL RO ##PE ##S SO THAT IN THE MORNING THE CHURCH ##WARD ##ENS HAD NO MEANS OF SUM ##M ##ON ##ING THE FAITH ##FUL TO EARLY MA ##S ##S
THIS IS THE AM ##US ##ING ADV ##ENT ##URE WHICH CLOSE ##D OUR EXPL ##O ##ITS
IN EVERY ONE OF THE SEVENT ##Y TWO PAR ##ISH ##ES OF THE CITY OF VE ##N ##ICE THERE IS A LARGE PUBLIC HOUSE CALLED MAG ##AZ ##Z ##IN ##O
YET THERE ARE A FEW PRIV ##ATE ROOM ##S WHICH CONT ##AIN A TABLE SUR ##RO ##UND ##ED WITH BE ##N ##CHES IN WHICH A RESPECT ##ABLE FAMILY OR A FEW FRIENDS CAN ENJ ##OY THEMSELVES IN A DEC ##ENT WAY
THE WAIT ##ER OF THE MAG ##AZ ##Z ##IN ##O CAME TO BE PA ##ID AND OUR CHIEF GAVE HIM WHAT WAS DU ##E ENJ ##O ##INING SILENCE UNDER PEN ##AL ##TY OF DEATH
WE TOOK OUR THREE PRISON ##ERS TO A LARGE BOAT
WHERE IS MY HUSBAND
NEVER FEAR YOU SHALL SEE HIM AGAIN TO MOR ##RO ##W
MY READ ##ERS MAY IMAG ##INE WHETHER WE FELT INCL ##INED TO LAUGH WHEN THE CHAR ##MING CREAT ##URE BAD ##E US GOOD NIGHT THAN ##KING US ALL WITH PERFECT GOOD FAITH
TWO DAYS AFTER ##WARDS OUR NO ##CT ##URN ##AL OR ##GY BEGAN TO BE TALK ##ED OF
IT WENT ON TO SAY THAT THE TWO MEN WHO HAD CARRIED HER OFF HAD TAKEN HER TO SUCH A PLACE WHERE THEY HAD AN HOUR LATER BEEN MET BY THE OTHER SIX AND THAT THEY HAD ALL REP ##AIR ##ED TO THE TWO SW ##ORD ##S WHERE THEY HAD SPE ##N ##T AN HOUR IN DRINK ##ING
THERE WAS NO CO ##WARD ##LY TRA ##IT ##OR AMONG ##ST US ALTHOUGH WE WERE ALL POOR BUT FEAR HAD ITS EFFECT AND OUR NO ##CT ##URN ##AL PR ##ANK ##S WERE NOT RE ##NE ##W ##ED
I P ##ICKED IT UP AND COMING UP TO HIM JUST AS HE WAS GOING DOWN THE STEP ##S I HAND ##ED IT TO HIM
I TOLD HIM AND HE INS ##IST ##ED UPON MY COMING WITH HIM IN THE GO ##ND ##OL ##A SAYING THAT HE WOULD LEAVE ME AT MY HOUSE
I RU ##B ##BED IT WITH ALL MY STRENGTH BUT HE TOLD ME IN A SORT OF IND ##IST ##INCT WHIS ##PER THAT THE NUM ##B ##NESS WAS SPR ##EAD ##ING ALL ALONG THE LEFT SIDE AND THAT HE WAS D ##YING
I J ##UMP ##ED OUT OF THE GO ##ND ##OL ##A AND FOUND MYSELF ON THE VERY SP ##OT WHERE THREE YEARS BEFORE I HAD T ##AUGHT RA ##Z ##ET ##T ##A SUCH A FOR ##CI ##BLE LESS ##ON I EN ##QU ##IRED FOR A SUR ##GE ##ON AT THE FIRST CO ##FF ##EE HOUSE AND RAN TO THE HOUSE THAT WAS POINT ##ED OUT TO ME
TAKING EVERYTHING UPON MYSELF I ORDER ##ED A SERV ##ANT TO HUR ##RY OUT FOR A PH ##YS ##IC ##IAN WHO CAME IN A SHORT TIME AND ORDER ##ED THE PAT ##IENT TO BE BL ##ED AGAIN THUS APPRO ##VING THE FIRST BL ##EE ##D ##ING PRES ##CRIB ##ED BY ME
THINKING I HAD A RIGHT TO WATCH THE S ##ICK MAN I SET ##TLE ##D MYSELF NEAR HIS BED TO GIVE HIM EVERY CARE HE REQU ##IRED
THEY DID NOT KNOW WHO I WAS AND DID NOT LIKE TO ASK ME WH ##ILS ##T I THOUGHT IT BETTER TO PRES ##ER ##VE A MO ##DE ##ST SILENCE
HE HAD G ##AM ##BLE ##D AND LOST A GREAT DEAL AND HIS BROTHER WAS HIS MOST BIT ##TER ENEM ##Y BECAUSE HE WAS INF ##AT ##U ##ATED WITH THE IDEA THAT HE HAD TRIED TO PO ##ISON HIM
THE PH ##YS ##IC ##IAN WHO ATT ##END ##ED HIM WAS NAME ##D TER ##RO HE THOUGHT BY SOME PE ##CUL ##IAR TRA ##IN OF REASON ##ING THAT HE COULD CUR ##E HIM BY APP ##LY ##ING A MER ##C ##UR ##IAL O ##INT ##MENT TO THE CHE ##ST TO WHICH NO ONE RA ##ISED ANY OBJECT ##ION
DELIGHT ##ED WITH SUCH A FORT ##UN ##ATE RES ##ULT WE LAY DOWN AGAIN
HE ENT ##REAT ##ED ME TO TELL HIM THE TRUTH
WHAT EXT ##RA ##ORD ##INARY THINGS WILL SOMETIMES OCC ##UR FROM MERE CHANCE OR FROM THE FORCE OF CIRCUMST ##ANCES
UN ##W ##ILL ##ING TO HUR ##T HIS VAN ##ITY BY TELL ##ING HIM THAT HE WAS MIST ##AKEN I TOOK THE WILD RESOL ##UTION OF INFORM ##ING HIM IN THE PRES ##ENCE OF HIS TWO FRIENDS THAT I POSS ##ESSED A CERTAIN NUM ##ER ##AL CAL ##CUL ##US WHICH GAVE ANSWER ##S ALSO IN NUMBER ##S TO ANY QUESTION ##S I LIKE ##D TO PUT
I OB ##EY ##ED IMP ##LIC ##IT ##LY AND MET YOUR EXC ##ELL ##EN ##CY
THE THREE FRIENDS WERE AST ##OUNDED
I DECL ##ARED MYSELF QUITE WILL ##ING FOR IT WAS NECESSARY TO BRA ##Z ##EN IT OUT AFTER HAVING VE ##N ##T ##URED AS FAR AS I HAD DONE
HE WR ##OTE THE QUESTION AND GAVE IT TO ME I READ IT I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND EITHER THE SUBJECT OR THE MEAN ##ING OF THE WORDS BUT IT DID NOT MATTER I HAD TO GIVE AN ANSWER
IF THE QUESTION WAS SO OBS ##C ##URE THAT I COULD NOT MAKE OUT THE SENSE OF IT IT WAS NATURAL THAT I SHOULD NOT UNDERSTAND THE ANSWER
THEY ALL ASKED ME HOW LONG I WOULD REQU ##IRE TO TE ##ACH THEM THE RU ##LES OF MY SUB ##L ##IME CAL ##CUL ##US
NOT VERY LONG I ANSWERED AND I WILL TE ##ACH YOU AS YOU WISH ALTHOUGH THE HER ##M ##IT ASS ##URED ME THAT I WOULD DIE SUDDENLY WITHIN THREE DAYS IF I COMM ##UN ##IC ##ATED MY SC ##IENCE TO ANY ##ONE BUT I HAVE NO FAITH WHATEVER IN THAT PRE ##D ##ICT ##ION
THEY BELIEVE ##D THAT THROUGH ME THEY POSS ##ESSED THE PHIL ##OS ##OP ##HER ' S STONE THE UN ##IVER ##S ##AL PA ##N ##ACE ##A THE INTER ##CO ##UR ##SE WITH ALL THE ELE ##MENT ##ARY HEAVEN ##LY AND INF ##ERN ##AL SPIRIT ##S THEY HAD NO DOUBT WHATEVER THAT THAN ##KS TO MY SUB ##L ##IME SC ##IENCE THEY COULD FIND OUT THE SECRET ##S OF EVERY GOVERN ##MENT IN E ##UR ##OP ##E
BUT ALTHOUGH BELIE ##VING FULL ##Y IN MY OR ##AC ##LES THEY WERE TOO KIND HEART ##ED TO THINK THEM THE WORK OF THE DEV ##IL AND IT SU ##ITED THEIR NATURAL GOOD ##NESS BETTER TO BELIEVE MY ANSWER ##S INS ##P ##IRED BY SOME HEAVEN ##LY SPIRIT
THEY WERE NOT ONLY GOOD CHRIST ##IANS AND FAITH ##FUL TO THE CHURCH BUT EVEN REAL DEV ##OTE ##ES AND FULL OF SC ##RU ##PLE ##S
AS FOR THE E ##U ##CH ##AR ##IST TRANS ##UB ##ST ##ANT ##IA ##T ##ION THE REAL PRES ##ENCE IT WAS ALL NO MY ##STER ##Y TO THEM BUT PAL ##P ##ABLE EV ##IDENCE AND YET THEY WERE NOT JE ##S ##U ##ITS
I MIGHT BE TOLD THAT IF I HAD WISH ##ED TO FOLLOW THE RU ##LES OF PUR ##E MOR ##ALITY I OUGHT EITHER TO HAVE DECL ##INED INT ##IM ##ATE INTER ##CO ##UR ##SE WITH THEM OR TO HAVE UN ##DE ##CEIVED THEM
BESIDES I FOUND IT VERY FL ##ATTER ##ING TO MY VAN ##ITY TO BECOME THE SUBJECT OF THE SPE ##CUL ##ATIVE CH ##ATTER ##ING OF EM ##PT ##Y FOOL ##S WHO HAVING NOTHING ELSE TO DO ARE ALWAYS TRY ##ING TO FIND OUT THE CAUSE OF EVERY MOR ##AL PH ##EN ##OME ##N ##ON THEY MEET WITH WHICH THEIR N ##ARR ##OW INTELL ##ECT CANNOT UNDERSTAND
WHO ##EVER YOU MAY BE I AM INDE ##B ##TED TO YOU FOR MY LIFE
YOUR AP ##ART ##MENT IS READY YOU MAY SEND YOUR CLOTH ##ES YOU SHALL HAVE A SERV ##ANT A GO ##ND ##OL ##A AT YOUR ORDER ##S MY OWN TABLE AND TEN SE ##QU ##INS A MONTH
YOU NEED NOT THINK OF THE F ##UT ##URE THINK ONLY OF ENJ ##OY ##ING YOURSELF AND TAKE ME AS YOUR ADV ##ISE ##R IN EVERYTHING THAT MAY HAPP ##EN TO YOU IN EVERYTHING YOU MAY WISH TO UNDER ##T ##AKE AND YOU MAY BE CERTAIN OF ALWAYS FIND ##ING ME YOUR FRIEND
I THR ##EW MYSELF AT HIS FEET TO ASS ##URE HIM OF MY GRA ##T ##ITUDE AND EMB ##RA ##CED HIM CALL ##ING HIM MY FATHER
SIR ED ##WARD NOT WHO ##LLY DISC ##OURA ##GED BY THE DEN ##IAL WITH WHICH DO ##R ##RI ##FORT ##H HAD WITH DEL ##IC ##AC ##Y ACQU ##AINT ##ED HIM STILL HOPE ##D FOR A KIND REC ##EPT ##ION AND WAS SO OFTEN AT THE HOUSE OF MISSUS HOR ##TON THAT LORD FRE ##DER ##ICK ' S JE ##AL ##OUS ##Y WAS EXC ##ITED AND THE TO ##R ##T ##URES HE SUFF ##ERED IN CONSE ##QU ##ENCE CONV ##INCE ##D HIM BEYOND A DOUBT OF THE SINCE ##RI ##TY OF HIS AFF ##ECT ##ION
EVERY TIME HE BEH ##EL ##D THE OBJECT OF HIS PASS ##ION FOR HE STILL CONTINUED HIS VISIT ##S THOUGH NOT SO FRE ##QU ##ENTLY AS HERE ##TO ##FORE HE PLE ##ADE ##D HIS CAUSE WITH SUCH AR ##D ##OUR THAT MISS WOOD ##LEY WHO WAS SOMETIMES PRESENT AND EVER COMP ##ASS ##ION ##ATE COULD NOT RES ##IST WISH ##ING HIM SUCCESS
YET DID THE WATCH ##FUL MISS WOOD ##LEY OFTEN ##T ##IMES HEAR A S ##IGH ESC ##APE FROM HER UN ##K ##N ##OWN TO HERSELF TILL SHE WAS REM ##IND ##ED OF IT AND THEN A SUDDEN BL ##USH WOULD INST ##ANTLY OVER ##S ##PR ##EAD HER FACE
NIGHT AFTER NIGHT HIS SLEEP HAD BEEN DIST ##UR ##BED BY FEAR ##S FOR HER WHEN AB ##RO ##AD MORNING AFTER MORNING IT HAD BEEN BR ##OKEN BY THE CL ##AM ##OUR OF HER RETURN
I HOPE MISS MIL ##NER YOU PASS THIS EVENING AT HOME
I THOUGHT MISS MIL ##NER YOU GAVE ME YOUR WORD THAT YOU WOULD PASS THIS EVENING AT HOME
YES INDEED AND I BELIEVE IT IS RIGHT THAT I SHOULD KEEP MY FIRST PROM ##ISE IS IT NOT
MISSUS HOR ##TON ROSE FROM HER SEA ##T MOVE ##D THE DEC ##ANT ##ERS AND FR ##U ##IT ROUND THE TABLE ST ##IR ##RED THE FIRE AND CAME BACK TO HER SEA ##T AGAIN BEFORE ANOTHER WORD WAS UT ##TERED

MISS MIL ##NER YOU SHALL NOT LEAVE THE HOUSE THIS EVENING SIR

HER HAND FELL MOT ##ION ##LESS FROM THAT WHICH SHE HELD SHE APPEARED MOT ##ION ##LESS HERSELF TILL MISSUS HOR ##TON BES ##EE ##CHING HER NOT TO BE UN ##E ##AS ##Y AT THE TREAT ##MENT SHE HAD RECEIVED MADE HER TEARS FLO ##W AS IF HER HEART WAS BREAK ##ING
IT WAS NOT FROM ANY REAL CAUSE OF GR ##IEF THAT SHE WE ##PT BUT THERE WAS A MAG ##NE ##T ##IC QU ##ALITY IN TEARS WHICH ALWAYS ATT ##RA ##CTED HER ' S
DO YOU THINK I WOULD GO ANSWERED MISS MIL ##NER WITH AN E ##AGER ##NESS THAT FOR A TIME SUPP ##RESSED HER TEARS IN CONTR ##AD ##ICT ##ION TO HIS WILL
IF YOU THINK SO MAD ##AM I SEE NOTHING THAT SHOULD PRE ##VENT ME NOW
N ##IE ##CE I COMMAND YOU NOT TO ST ##IR OUT OF THIS ROOM THIS EVENING
MISS WOOD ##LEY OB ##ED ##IENT ##LY SAT DOWN AND THOUGH HER THOUGHTS AND HEART WERE IN THE CH ##AM ##BER OF HER FRIEND SHE NEVER MAR ##KED BY ONE IMP ##ERT ##INE ##N ##T WORD OR BY ONE LINE OF HER FACE THE REST ##RA ##INT SHE SUFF ##ERED
AT THE US ##UAL HOUR MISTER DO ##R ##RI ##FORT ##H AND HIS WAR ##D WERE SUM ##M ##ONE ##D TO TE ##A HE ENTERED WITH A COUNT ##EN ##ANCE WHICH EV ##INCE ##D THE REM ##AINS OF ANG ##ER HIS EYE GAVE TE ##ST ##IM ##ONY OF HIS ABS ##ENT THOUGHTS AND THOUGH HE TOOK UP A PA ##M ##PH ##LE ##T AFF ##ECT ##ING TO READ IT WAS PLAIN TO DISC ##ERN THAT HE SCARCE ##LY KNEW HE HELD IT IN HIS HAND
MISS WOOD ##LEY THOUGHT IT HER DUT ##Y TO BE MU ##TE AND NOW THE GI ##NG ##LE OF A TE ##A SP ##OON WAS LIKE A DEEP TONE ##D BELL ALL WAS SO QUIET
MISSUS HOR ##TON TOO IN THE SELF APPRO ##VING REF ##LE ##CTION THAT SHE WAS NOT IN A QUAR ##RE ##L OR AL ##TER ##C ##ATION OF ANY KIND FELT HERSELF AT THIS MOMENT REMARK ##ABLY PEACE ##FUL AND CHAR ##IT ##ABLE

AFTER A FEW MINUTES PA ##USE AND SOME LITTLE EMB ##ARR ##ASS ##MENT ON THE PART OF MISSUS HOR ##TON AT THE DISAPP ##OINT ##MENT SHE HAD TO ENC ##OUNT ##ER FROM THIS UN ##E ##X ##PECT ##ED DUT ##IFUL COND ##UCT SHE ASKED MISS MIL ##NER IF SHE WOULD NOW HAVE ANY TE ##A

AT LAST HE SENT WORD TO SAY THAT HE HIMSELF WOULD BE IN ENGLAND BEFORE THE END OF MAR ##CH AND WOULD SEE THAT THE MAJ ##EST ##Y OF THE LAW SHOULD BE VI ##ND ##IC ##ATED IN HIS FAV ##OUR
IN MAKING THIS HE HAD EXPECT ##ED NO SUCCESS THOUGH FROM THE EN ##ER ##GE ##T ##IC NATURE OF HIS DISP ##OSITION HE HAD MADE THE ATTEMPT WITH SOME Z ##E ##AL
MISSUS BO ##Z ##Z ##LE WAS DISP ##OSED TO THINK THAT LAD ##IES OF QU ##ALITY AMONG WHOM MAD ##AME T WAS ENT ##IT ##LED IN HER EST ##IM ##ATION TO TAKE RAN ##K WERE SE ##LD ##OM BETTER THAN THEY OUGHT TO BE AND SHE WAS QUITE WILL ##ING THAT HER HUSBAND SHOULD EAR ##N HIS BRE ##AD BY WATCH ##ING THE LADY OR THE LADY ' S LOVE ##R

IT IS WELL KNOWN THAT THE AMERIC ##AN IND ##IAN HAD SOME ##H ##OW DEV ##EL ##OP ##ED OCC ##ULT POWER AND ALTHOUGH IN THE LA ##T ##TER DAYS THERE HAVE BEEN MANY IMP ##OST ##ORS AND ALL ##OWING FOR THE VAN ##ITY AND WE ##AK ##NESS OF HUMAN NATURE IT IS FAIR TO ASS ##UM ##E THAT THERE MUST HAVE BEEN SOME EVEN IN THE OLD DAYS YET THERE ARE WELL ATT ##ESTED INST ##ANCES OF REMARK ##ABLE PROP ##H ##E ##CI ##ES AND OTHER MY ##ST ##IC PRACT ##ICE
NO DOUBT MANY PRE ##D ##ICT ##IONS HAVE BEEN COL ##ORED TO SU ##IT THE NEW AGE AND UN ##QU ##EST ##ION ##ABLY FA ##LS ##E PROP ##H ##ETS FA ##K ##IR ##S AND CON ##J ##URE ##R ##S HAVE BECOME THE PE ##ST OF THE TRI ##BE ##S DURING THE TRANS ##ITION PER ##I ##OD
THIS WAS CARRIED OUT TO THE LETTER
THIS WAS ONLY ONE OF HIS REMARK ##ABLE PROP ##H ##E ##CI ##ES
ANOTHER FAM ##OUS MED ##IC ##INE MAN WAS BORN ON THE RU ##M RIVER ABOUT ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY YEARS AGO AND LIVED TO BE OVER A CENT ##URY OLD
AT THE AGE OF ABOUT SEVENT ##Y FIVE YEARS HE SAVE ##D HIS B ##AND FROM UT ##TER DEST ##RU ##CTION AT THE HANDS OF THEIR AN ##CES ##T ##RA ##L ENEM ##IES BY SUDDENLY GI ##VING WAR ##NING RECEIVED IN A DREAM OF THE APPROACH OF A LARGE WAR PARTY
FIVE YEARS LATER HE REPE ##ATED THE SERV ##ICE AND AGAIN SAVE ##D HIS PEOPLE FROM AW ##FUL SLA ##UGHT ##ER
THERE ARE MANY TR ##UST ##W ##ORT ##H ##Y MEN AND MEN OF CHRIST ##IAN FAITH TO VO ##U ##CH FOR THESE AND SIM ##IL ##AR EVEN ##TS OCC ##UR ##RI ##NG AS FORE ##TO ##LD
AT ANOTHER TIME WHEN I WAS FOUR ##TEEN YEARS OLD WE HAD JUST LEFT FORT EL ##L ##IS ON THE ASS ##IN ##IB ##O ##INE RIVER AND MY YOUNG ##EST UNCLE HAD SE ##LE ##CTED A FINE SP ##OT FOR OUR NIGHT CAMP
MANY OF THE IND ##IANS BELIEVE ##D THAT ONE MAY BE BORN MORE THAN ONCE AND THERE WERE SOME WHO CL ##A ##IME ##D TO HAVE FULL KNOWLEDGE OF A FORM ##ER INC ##AR ##N ##ATION
THERE WAS A WELL KNOWN S ##I ##OU ##X WAR PROP ##H ##ET WHO LIVED IN THE MID ##DLE OF THE LAST CENT ##URY SO THAT HE IS STILL REMEMBER ##ED BY THE OLD MEN OF HIS B ##AND
SH ##IL ##O ##H
THIS WAS THE FIRST BIG BAT ##TLE IN WHICH OUR REG ##IMENT HAD EVER BEEN ENG ##AGED
I DO NOT PRET ##END TO TELL OF WHAT COMMAND DIST ##ING ##U ##ISHED ITSELF OF HER ##O ##ES OF BLOOD AND WO ##UND ##S OF SH ##RIE ##KS AND GR ##O ##ANS OF BR ##ILL ##IAN ##T CHAR ##GE ##S OF CAN ##N ##ON CAP ##T ##URED E ##T CE ##TER ##A
ABOUT DAY ##L ##IGHT ON SUN ##DAY MORNING CH ##AL ##MER ##S BR ##IG ##ADE REL ##IE ##VED GLAD ##DEN ' S
AS GLAD ##DEN RO ##DE BY US A COUR ##IER RO ##DE UP AND TOLD HIM SOMETHING
ON SUN ##DAY MORNING A CLEAR BEAUTIFUL AND STILL DAY THE ORDER WAS GIVEN FOR THE WHOLE ARM ##Y TO ADV ##ANCE AND TO ATT ##ACK IMMEDIATELY
WE WERE SUPP ##ORT ##ING AN AL ##AB ##AM ##A BR ##IG ##ADE
THAT ' S RIGHT MY BRA ##VE FIRST TEN ##NESS ##EE GIVE EM HA ##IL COL ##UMB ##IA
THE FACT WAS KEPT FROM THE TR ##OO ##PS
WE HAD TO PASS OVER THE GROUND WHERE TR ##OO ##PS HAD BEEN FIGHT ##ING ALL DAY
I HAD HEARD AND READ OF BAT ##TLE ##F ##IELD ##S SEEN PICT ##URES OF BAT ##TLE ##F ##IELD ##S OF HORSE ##S AND MEN OF CAN ##N ##ON AND WA ##G ##ONS ALL J ##UMB ##LED TOGETHER WHILE THE GROUND WAS STRE ##WN WITH DEAD AND D ##YING AND WO ##UND ##ED BUT I MUST CONF ##ESS THAT I NEVER REAL ##IZED THE PO ##M ##P AND CIRCUMST ##ANCE OF THE THING CALLED GL ##OR ##IOUS WAR UNTIL I SAW THIS
I HAD BEEN FEELING MEAN ALL THE MORNING AS IF I HAD STO ##LE ##N A SHE ##EP BUT WHEN THE ORDER TO CHAR ##GE WAS GIVEN I GOT HAPPY
OFFIC ##ERS COULD NOT CUR ##B THE MEN TO KEEP IN LINE
ON MON ##DAY THE T ##IDE WAS REV ##ERS ##ED
BUT AS I SAID BEFORE READ ##ER A PRIV ##ATE SOLD ##IER IS BUT AN A ##UT ##OM ##AT ##ON AND KNOW ##S NOTHING OF WHAT IS GOING ON AMONG THE GENERAL ##S AND I AM ONLY GI ##VING THE CHR ##ON ##IC ##LES OF LITTLE THINGS AND EVEN ##TS THAT CAME UNDER MY OWN OBSER ##V ##ATION AS I SAW THEM THEN AND REMEMBER THEM NOW
SHOULD YOU DESIRE TO FIND OUT MORE ABOUT THE BAT ##TLE I REF ##ER YOU TO HIST ##ORY
ABOUT THE TIME HE PULL ##ED TRI ##GG ##ER A STRA ##Y B ##ALL FROM SOME DIRECT ##ION STRUCK HIM IN THE SIDE AND HE FELL OFF DEAD AND HIS HORSE BEC ##OM ##ING FRIGHT ##ENED G ##ALL ##OP ##ED OFF DRA ##GG ##ING HIM THROUGH THE CONF ##ED ##ER ##ATE LINE ##S
ON MON ##DAY MORNING I TOO CAP ##T ##URED ME A MU ##LE
HE WAS W ##ISE IN HIS OWN CON ##CEI ##T
I FRE ##QU ##ENTLY THOUGHT IT WOULD BE PLEAS ##ANT TO SP ##L ##IT THE DIFFER ##ENCE WITH THAT MU ##LE AND I WOULD GLAD ##LY HAVE DONE SO IF I COULD HAVE GOT ##TEN ONE HALF OF HIS NO
MU ##LE DID NOT DESIRE TO CROSS WHILE I WAS TRY ##ING TO PERS ##U ##ADE HIM WITH A BIG ST ##ICK A ROCK IN HIS EAR AND A TW ##ISTER ON HIS NO ##SE
SO HE GOT A LARGE TWO INC ##H RO ##PE T ##IED ONE END AROUND THE MU ##LE ' S NE ##CK AND THE OTHER TO THE CA ##ISS ##ON AND ORDER ##ED THE DRI ##VER TO WH ##IP UP
THE RO ##PE HOWEVER WAS STRONG ##ER THAN THE MU ##LE ' S NO AND HE WAS FIN ##ALLY PRE ##V ##AIL ##ED UPON BY THE STRENGTH OF THE RO ##PE TO CROSS THE CRE ##E ##K
ON MY TAKING THE RO ##PE OFF HE SHO ##OK HIMSELF AND SEEMED TO SAY YOU THINK THAT YOU ARE MIGHT ##Y SM ##ART FO ##L ##KS BUT YOU ARE A LE ##ET ##LE TOO SM ##ART
WE REM ##AINED SEVERAL MONTH ##S BUT SOON WE WERE ON THE TRA ##M ##P AGAIN
THE FE ##DER ##AL ARM ##Y WAS CON ##CE ##N ##T ##RA ##TING AT N ##ASH ##V ##ILL ##E THERE WAS NO REST FOR THE WE ##ARY
OUR ARM ##Y STOPPED AT MUR ##F ##REE ##S ##BO ##RO
FROM TIME TO TIME DIFFERENT REG ##IMENT ##S WERE SENT FORWARD TO DO P ##ICK ##ET DUT ##Y
THE Y ##ANK ##EE P ##ICK ##ET LINE ##S WERE NOT A HALF MIL ##E OFF
I AM A VI ##DE ##T YOU KNOW THE RES ##P ##ONS ##IB ##ILITY REST ##ING ON ME
SAYS HE I WOULD NOT TR ##UST A SEC ##ESH ON HIS WORD O ##ATH OR BO ##ND MAR ##CH I SAY
I SOON FOUND OUT THAT HE HAD CAUGHT SIGHT OF THE REL ##IEF ON THE ROAD AND WAS AFRAID TO SHO ##OT I QUICKLY MADE UP MY MIND
MY GU ##N WAS AT MY FEET AND ONE STEP WOULD GET IT
I MADE A QUICK GL ##ANCE OVER MY SHOULD ##ER AND GRA ##B ##BED AT MY GU ##N
HE DIV ##INED MY MOT ##IVE AND FIRE ##D THE B ##ALL MISS ##ED ITS A ##IM
I THINK WE MUST HAVE K ##ILLED A GOOD MANY IN THE OLD FIELD BECAUSE WE WERE FIR ##ING ALL THE TIME AT THE SOL ##ID LINE AS THEY ADV ##ANCED UPON US
WE KEPT FALL ##ING BACK AND FIR ##ING ALL DAY AND WERE REL ##IE ##VED BY ANOTHER REG ##IMENT ABOUT DARK WE RE ##J ##O ##INED OUR REG ##IMENT
LINE OF BAT ##TLE WAS FORM ##ED ON THE NORTH BANK OF STONE ' S RIVER ON THE Y ##ANK ##EE SIDE
BAD GENERAL ##SHIP I THOUGHT IT WAS CHRIST ##MA ##S
THE PRIV ##ATE COULD BUT HE WAS NO GENERAL YOU SEE
I CALLED LIE ##UTE ##N ##ANT COL ##ONE ##L FR ##IERS ##ON ' S ATTENTION TO THE Y ##ANK ##EE ##S AND HE REMARK ##ED WELL I DON ' T KNOW WHETHER THEY ARE Y ##ANK ##EE ##S OR NOT BUT IF THEY ARE THEY WILL COME OUT OF THERE MIGHT ##Y QUICK
THE Y ##ANK ##EE ##S MAR ##CHED OVER THE HILL OUT OF SIGHT
WE WERE ORDER ##ED FORWARD TO THE ATT ##ACK
WE WERE RIGHT UPON THE Y ##ANK ##EE LINE ON THE W ##IL ##KE ##R ##SON TURN ##P ##IKE
WE WERE NOT TWENTY Y ##ARDS OFF FROM THE Y ##ANK ##EE ##S AND THEY WERE PO ##URING THE HOT SHO ##T AND SHE ##LL ##S RIGHT INTO OUR RAN ##KS AND EVERY MAN WAS YE ##LL ##ING AT THE TOP OF HIS VOICE CE ##ASE FIR ##ING YOU ARE FIR ##ING ON YOUR OWN MEN CE ##ASE FIR ##ING YOU ARE FIR ##ING ON YOUR OWN MEN
O ##AK ##LEY COL ##OR BEAR ##ER OF THE FOUR ##TH TEN ##NESS ##EE REG ##IMENT RAN RIGHT UP IN THE MID ##ST OF THE Y ##ANK ##EE LINE WITH HIS COL ##ORS BEG ##GING HIS MEN TO FOLLOW
THE LEAD ##EN HA ##IL STO ##R ##M SWE ##PT THEM OFF THE FIELD THEY FELL BACK AND RE FORM ##ED
WE WERE AT THAT TIME AT LEAST A HUNDRED Y ##ARDS IN ADV ##ANCE OF THE BR ##IG ##ADE CHE ##ATH ##AM ALL THE TIME CALL ##ING UPON THE MEN TO COME ON
I SAW AND FELT THAT HE WAS NOT FIGHT ##ING FOR GL ##ORY BUT THAT HE WAS FIGHT ##ING FOR HIS COUNTRY BECAUSE HE LOVED THAT COUNTRY AND HE WAS WILL ##ING TO GIVE HIS LIFE FOR HIS COUNTRY AND THE SUCCESS OF OUR CAUSE
I THOUGHT IT HAD BEEN TO ##R ##N FROM MY SHOULD ##ER
AS I WENT BACK TO THE FIELD HO ##S ##P ##IT ##AL I OVER ##TO ##OK ANOTHER MAN WALK ##ING ALONG
I LOOKED AT IT PRETTY CLOSE AND I SAID GREAT GOD
HE WAS WALK ##ING ALONG WHEN ALL AT ONCE HE DRO ##PPED DOWN AND DIED WITHOUT A STR ##UGG ##LE OR A GR ##O ##AN
BUT I COULD NOT BEAR THE THOUGHT OF WE ##ARING DEAD MEN ' S SHO ##ES
HE WAS STONE DEAD BUT I DRO ##PPED THAT FOOT QUICK
BEFORE WE ARRI ##VED AT THE HOUSE WE SAW A BODY OF Y ##ANK ##EE ##S APPROACH ##ING AND AS WE START ##ED TO RUN BACK THEY FIRE ##D UPON US
OUR P ##ICK ##ETS HAD RUN IN AND REP ##ORT ##ED A NIGHT ATT ##ACK
ADV ##ANCE INTO TEN ##NESS ##EE
Y ##ANK SAYS WHAT YOU DOING JOHN ##NY
WE PASSED AROUND AT ##LA ##N ##T ##A CROSS ##ED THE CH ##AT ##T ##AH ##OO ##CH ##EE AND TRA ##VEL ##ED BACK OVER THE SAME RO ##UTE ON WHICH WE HAD MADE THE AR ##DU ##OUS CAMP ##A ##IGN UNDER JO ##E JOHN ##ST ##ON
OUT ##SIDE OF THESE OCCASION ##AL REM ##IND ##ERS WE COULD SEE NO EV ##IDENCE OF THE DES ##OL ##ATION OF THE TRA ##CK OF AN INV ##AD ##ING ARM ##Y
WE SAW THE UN ##ITED STATE ##S FL ##AG FL ##YING FROM THE RA ##M ##PAR ##TS AND THOUGHT THAT Y ##ANK WOULD PROB ##ABLY BE AS ##LE ##EP OR CAT ##CHING LI ##CE OR MAY ##BE ENG ##AGED IN A G ##AME OF SEVEN UP
HE WALKED UP AND SAYS HEL ##L ##O BOYS WHAT IS IT BO ##S ##S
A Y ##ANK ##EE ALWAYS SAYS N ##AGER
THEY PERS ##U ##ADE ##D EL ##O ##QU ##ENTLY
A MAN IN THE WELL
THE VOICE APPEARED TO BE OVER ##H ##EAD
RIGHT BEFORE ME I SAW THE LONG DR ##Y GRA ##S ##S ALL BE ##ND ##ING TOWARD A COMMON CENT ##ER AND I KNEW THAT IT WAS AN OLD WELL AND THAT MY COM ##RA ##DE HAD FALL ##EN IN IT
BUT HOW TO GET HIM OUT WAS THE UN ##SO ##L ##VED PROB ##LE ##M
THE POOR FELLOW STAY ##ED IN THAT WELL ALL NIGHT
WE LOOKED ALL AROUND AND THOUGHT THAT THE CO ##AST WAS CLEAR
I DON ' T THINK HIS GU ##N WAS LO ##ADE ##D THOUGH BECAUSE WE DID NOT HEAR THE B ##ALL WHIS ##TLE
WE WALKED OVER THIS FLO ##ATING BR ##ID ##GE AND SOON FOUND OUR ##SELVES ON THE TEN ##NESS ##EE SIDE OF TEN ##NESS ##EE RIVER
WE HAD BE ##E ##F FOR SUPP ##ER THAT NIGHT
HOW EVERY P ##UL ##SE DID BE ##AT AND LEA ##P AND HOW EVERY HEART DID THR ##O ##B WITH EM ##OT ##IONS OF JOY WHICH SEEMED NEARLY A ##K ##IN TO HEAVEN WHEN WE RECEIVED THE GLAD INTELL ##IG ##ENCE OF OUR ON ##WARD MAR ##CH TOWARD THE LAND OF PROM ##ISE AND OF OUR LOVED ONE ##S
WE WERE IN ##URED TO PRIV ##ATIONS AND HARD ##SHIP ##S HAD BEEN UPON EVERY MAR ##CH IN EVERY BAT ##TLE IN EVERY SK ##IR ##M ##ISH IN EVERY ADV ##ANCE IN EVERY RET ##REAT IN EVERY VICT ##ORY IN EVERY DEF ##E ##AT
HE WANTED TO GO BY HOME AND TELL HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN GOOD BY ##E AND TO GET HIS CLOTH ##ES IT WAS NO GO
BUT AFTER AW ##H ##ILE J ##IM SAYS GENTLE ##MEN A ##Y G ##AN ##NY THE LAW
YOU SEE J ##IM KNOW ##ED THE LAW
THOSE OLD SOLD ##IERS HAD LONG LONG AGO FORGOT ##TEN ABOUT THAT OLD LAW OF THE LONG GONE PAST BUT J ##IM HAD TRE ##AS ##URED IT UP IN HIS MEM ##ORY LO THESE MANY YEARS AND HE THOUGHT IT WOULD SERV ##E HIM NOW AS IT HAD NO DOUBT FRE ##QU ##ENTLY DONE IN THE PAST
THE THIRD DAY IT WAS REP ##ORT ##ED THAT THE Y ##ANK ##EE ##S HAD TAKEN POSITION ON THE MUR ##F ##REE ##S ##BO ##RO P ##IKE
A REG ##IMENT WAS SENT TO THE ATT ##ACK IT WAS J ##IM ' S REG ##IMENT
HE HAD ##N ' T SEEN ANYTHING TO SHO ##OT AT BUT HE BLA ##Z ##ED AWAY HE LO ##ADE ##D AND FIRE ##D THE SECOND TIME WHEN THEY WERE ORDER ##ED TO RET ##REAT
BUT IS LAUGH ##TER A SY ##N ##ONY ##M OF JOY
SUCH PERFECT COMPLE ##TEN ##ESS IS NOT IN NATURE
HAD G ##W ##Y ##N ##PL ##AIN ##E WHEN A CHILD BEEN SO WORTH ##Y OF ATTENTION THAT HIS FACE HAD BEEN SUBJECT ##ED TO TRANS ##M ##UT ##ATION WHY NOT
ACCORD ##ING TO ALL APPEAR ##ANCE IND ##UST ##RI ##OUS MAN ##IP ##UL ##AT ##ORS OF CHILDREN HAD WORK ##ED UPON HIS FACE

IT WAS G ##W ##Y ##N ##PL ##AIN ##E ' S LAUGH WHICH CREAT ##ED THE LAUGH ##TER OF OTHERS YET HE DID NOT LAUGH HIMSELF
THE OUT ##SIDE DID NOT DEP ##END ON THE INTER ##IOR
NO ONE COULD ESC ##APE FROM THIS R ##ICT ##US

FROM SIX ##TEEN EIGHT ##Y TO SEVENT ##EEN O FOUR A GREAT CHANGE HAD TAKEN PLACE

WHAT A P ##ITY THAT HE SHOULD NOT BE A LORD
HE WOULD MAKE A FAM ##OUS SC ##OUND ##RE ##L
AT THAT HOUR THERE WAS NO ONE IN THE FAIR GROUND EXCEPT PERHAPS SOME RE ##EL ##ING DR ##UN ##K ##ARD MAKING ST ##AG ##GER ##ING SHAD ##OWS IN DARK CORN ##ERS
ON THE SECOND OF THE MONTH AT TWO IN THE MORNING OUR PRE ##CIOUS CAR ##G ##O OF LU ##GG ##AGE WAS TAKEN ON BO ##ARD THE GOOD SHIP VAL ##K ##Y ##RIE

MY UNCLE WAS DELIGHT ##ED FOR MYSELF MO ##OD ##Y AND DIS ##S ##AT ##ISF ##IED I APPEARED ALMOST TO EXPECT A GL ##IM ##PS ##E OF THE G ##H ##OST OF HA ##M ##LE ##T
BUT NO G ##H ##OST OR ANYTHING ELSE APPEARED UPON THE AN ##CIENT WALL ##S
THE FACT IS THE CAST ##LE IS MUCH LATER THAN THE TIME OF THE HER ##O ##IC PRINCE OF DEN ##MA ##R ##K
NO MISTER HARD ##W ##IG ##G SAID THE CAPTAIN NO FEAR OF THAT
AT ALL EVEN ##TS WE SHALL GET THERE SOME DAY
ON THE ELE ##VENT ##H DAY WE SIGHT ##ED CAP ##E PORT ##LAND OVER WHICH TO ##W ##ERED MO ##UNT MY ##R ##D ##ALS Y ##OK ##UL WHICH THE WE ##ATHER BEING CLEAR WE MADE OUT VERY READ ##ILY

ON ALL SIDE ##S WERE TO BE SEEN WHOLE SCHOOL ##S OF WH ##ALE ##S AND SHAR ##KS
NEARLY THE WHOLE PO ##P ##UL ##ATION OF THE TOWN WAS ON FOOT TO SEE US LAND
THE FACT WAS THAT SCARCE ##LY ANY ONE OF THEM BUT EXPECT ##ED SOME GOOD ##S BY THE PER ##I ##OD ##ICAL VE ##S ##SEL
THEN WITHOUT FURTHER REMARK HE PUT HIS FING ##ER TO HIS LIPS FR ##OWN ##ED DARK ##LY AND DES ##CE ##NDED INTO THE SMALL BOAT WHICH AW ##A ##ITED US
HE WAS HOWEVER BUT A C ##IV ##IL SERV ##ANT A MAG ##IST ##RA ##TE THE GOVERN ##OR OF THE ISLAND BAR ##ON TRA ##M ##PE

VERY LIKE ##LY I MAY FIND THERE SOME MAN ##US ##CRI ##PT ##S FROM THE HAND OF SA ##K ##N ##USS ##EM ##M
I SHALL BE GLAD TO CONS ##ULT THEM
THEY WERE NOW HOWEVER ABS ##ENT ON DUT ##Y

I HAVE NOT THE SLIGHT ##EST DOUBT THAT IN HIGH WIND ##S ITS RED T ##ILE ##S WERE BL ##OWN OUT TO THE GREAT ANN ##OY ##ANCE OF THE PAST ##OR AND CON ##GR ##E ##G ##ATION

OUR TWO HORSE ##S WITH THE LU ##GG ##AGE FOLLOWED OF THEIR OWN ACCORD WITHOUT REQU ##IR ##ING WH ##IP OR SP ##UR

WE TOOK OUR WAY THROUGH POOR AND SP ##ARS ##E ME ##AD ##OWS WHICH MADE A DESP ##ER ##ATE EFF ##ORT EVERY YEAR TO SHOW A LITTLE GREEN
THEY VERY RA ##RE ##LY SUCC ##EE ##D IN A GOOD SHOW OF YE ##LLOW
I COULD NOT HELP SM ##ILING TO SEE HIM LOOK SO BIG ON HIS LITTLE HORSE HIS LONG LEG ##S NOW AND THEN TOU ##CHING THE GROUND MADE HIM LOOK LIKE A SIX FOOT ##ED CENT ##AU ##R
SNOW TEM ##PE ##ST IMP ##RA ##CT ##IC ##ABLE ROAD ##S ROCK ##S I ##CE ##BER ##GS NOTHING STO ##PS HIM
WE MAY DO SO WAS MY REP ##LY BUT WHAT ABOUT OUR WORTH ##Y GU ##IDE
I SHOULD HAVE A VI ##OL ##ENT ATT ##ACK OF THE CRA ##M ##P IF I WERE NOT TO HAVE SOME SORT OF EX ##ER ##CI ##SE

IN THIS POSITION SHE REM ##AINED UNTIL A GENTLE HAND WAS LAID UPON HER SHOULD ##ER
I AM NOT THINKING ABOUT THE GARDEN MA ##M ##MA REPLIED THE YOUNG GIRL WITHOUT LI ##FT ##ING UP HER FACE WE CAN PLAN ##T NEW FLO ##W ##ERS AND T ##IE UP EVEN SOME OF THESE AF ##RES ##H
IN THOSE VERY EARLY TIMES THERE WAS A MAN NAME ##D DE ##U ##C ##AL ##ION AND HE WAS THE SON OF PROM ##ETH ##E ##US
AFTER J ##UP ##ITER HAD BOUND PROM ##ETH ##E ##US ON MO ##UNT CA ##U ##C ##AS ##US AND HAD SENT DIS ##E ##ASE ##S AND CARE ##S INTO THE WORLD MEN BECAME VERY VERY W ##ICKED
THESE MEN HE SAID TO HIS MIGHT ##Y COMPANY ARE NOTHING BUT A SOU ##R ##CE OF TROUBLE
BUT MEN KEPT ON FIGHT ##ING AND ROB ##B ##ING EVEN WHILE THE RA ##IN WAS PO ##URING DOWN AND THE SEA WAS COMING UP OVER THE LAND
NO ONE BUT DE ##U ##C ##AL ##ION THE SON OF PROM ##ETH ##E ##US WAS READY FOR SUCH A STO ##R ##M
THE DAY IS COMING SAID PROM ##ETH ##E ##US WHEN J ##UP ##ITER WILL SEND A FLO ##OD TO DEST ##RO ##Y MAN ##K ##IND FROM THE EARTH
BUT DE ##U ##C ##AL ##ION AND P ##Y ##R ##R ##H ##A WERE VERY SAD FOR THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE THE ONLY PERSON ##S WHO WERE LEFT AL ##IVE IN ALL THE LAND
IS THERE ANYTHING THAT YOU WISH HE ASKED
WE SHOULD LIKE ABOVE ALL THINGS SAID DE ##U ##C ##AL ##ION TO SEE THIS LAND FULL OF PEOPLE ONCE MORE FOR WITHOUT NEIGHB ##ORS AND FRIENDS THE WORLD IS A VERY LO ##NE ##LY PLACE INDEED
GO ON DOWN THE MOUNTAIN SAID MER ##C ##URY AND AS YOU GO CAST THE BO ##NE ##S OF YOUR MOTHER OVER YOUR SHOULD ##ERS BEHIND YOU AND WITH THESE WORDS HE LEA ##PE ##D INTO THE AIR AND WAS SEEN NO MORE
WHAT DID HE MEAN ASKED P ##Y ##R ##R ##H ##A
SURE ##LY I DO NOT KNOW SAID DE ##U ##C ##AL ##ION
WHEN AT LAST THEY REACHED THE PLAIN THEY FOUND THEMSELVES AT THE HEAD OF A NO ##BLE COMPANY OF HUMAN BEING ##S ALL E ##AGER TO SERV ##E THEM
WHEN AT LAST THE QUEEN GAVE B ##IRT ##H TO A DAUGHTER THE KING WAS SO OVER ##J ##OY ##ED THAT HE GAVE A GREAT CHRIST ##ENING FE ##AST THE LIKE OF WHICH HAD NEVER BEFORE BEEN KNOWN
ONE OF THE YOUNG FAIR ##IES OVER ##H ##EAR ##ING HER AND FAN ##CY ##ING SHE MIGHT WORK SOME MIS ##CH ##IEF TO THE LITTLE BAB ##Y WENT AND H ##ID HERSELF BEHIND THE HA ##NG ##INGS IN THE HALL SO AS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE LAST WORD AND UN ##D ##O ANY HAR ##M THE OLD FAIR ##Y MIGHT WISH TO WORK
THE TURN OF THE OLD FAIR ##Y HAD NOW COME AND SHE DECL ##ARED WHILE HER HEAD SHO ##OK WITH MA ##LIC ##E THAT THE PRINCESS SHOULD PIE ##R ##CE HER HAND WITH A SP ##IND ##LE AND DIE OF THE WO ##UND
IT IS TRUE I CANNOT ENTIRE ##LY UN ##D ##O WHAT MY EL ##DER HAS DONE
NOW FIF ##TEEN YEARS AFTER THE PRINCESS WAS BORN SHE WAS WITH THE KING AND QUEEN AT ONE OF THEIR CAST ##LES AND AS SHE WAS RUN ##NING ABOUT BY HERSELF SHE CAME TO A LITTLE CH ##AM ##BER AT THE TOP OF A TO ##W ##ER AND THERE SAT AN HON ##EST OLD WOMAN SP ##IN ##NING FOR SHE HAD NEVER HEARD OF THE KING ' S ED ##ICT
SHE HAD NO SOON ##ER TAKEN UP THE SP ##IND ##LE THAN BEING HAST ##Y AND CARE ##LESS SHE PIE ##R ##CED HER HAND WITH THE POINT OF IT AND FA ##INT ##ED AWAY
HE KNEW THAT SHE WOULD NOT AW ##AKE FOR A HUNDRED YEARS
ONE SAID IT WAS AN ENC ##H ##ANT ##ED CAST ##LE ANOTHER THAT W ##ITCH ##ES LIVED THERE BUT MOST BELIEVE ##D THAT IT WAS OCC ##UP ##IED BY A GREAT O ##GR ##E WHICH CARRIED TH ##ITHER ALL THE CHILDREN HE COULD CAT ##CH AND AT ##E THEM UP ONE AT A TIME FOR NO ##BODY COULD GET AT HIM THROUGH THE WOOD
THE YOUNG PRINCE AT THESE WORDS FELT HIMSELF ON FIRE
SCARCE ##LY HAD HE COME TO THE WOOD WHEN ALL THE TREES AND TH ##ORN ##S WHICH HAD MADE SUCH AN IMP ##ENE ##T ##RA ##BLE THICK ##ET OPENED ON ONE SIDE AND THE OTHER TO OFF ##ER HIM A PAT ##H
HE ENTERED A LARGE FORE ##CO ##UR ##T AND STOOD STILL WITH AM ##AZ ##EMENT AND AW ##E
BUT THE FACE ##S OF THE MEN WERE RO ##S ##Y AND THE GO ##BLE ##TS BY THEM HAD A FEW DRO ##PS OF WIN ##E LEFT
HE ENTERED THE GU ##ARD ROOM THERE THE GU ##ARDS STOOD DRAW ##N UP IN LINE WITH CAR ##B ##INES AT THEIR SHOULD ##ERS BUT THEY WERE SOUND AS ##LE ##EP
HE PASSED THROUGH ONE AP ##ART ##MENT AFTER ANOTHER WHERE WERE LAD ##IES AND GENTLE ##MEN AS ##LE ##EP IN THEIR CHAIR ##S OR STANDING
I HAVE WAIT ##ED LONG FOR YOU
THEY TALK ##ED FOR FOUR HOURS AND HAD NOT THEN SAID HALF THAT WAS IN THEIR HEAD ##S TO SAY
MEAN ##WH ##ILE ALL THE REST OF THE PEOPLE IN THE CAST ##LE HAD BEEN WA ##KE ##NED AT THE SAME MOMENT AS THE PRINCESS AND THEY WERE NOW EXT ##RE ##ME ##LY HUNG ##RY
THE LADY IN WAIT ##ING BECAME VERY IMP ##AT ##IENT AND AT LENGTH ANN ##OUN ##CED TO THE PRINCESS THAT THEY ALL WAIT ##ED FOR HER
THEN THE PRINCE TOOK THE PRINCESS BY THE HAND SHE WAS DRESS ##ED IN GREAT SP ##LE ##ND ##OUR BUT HE DID NOT H ##INT THAT SHE LOOKED AS HE HAD SEEN PICT ##URES OF HIS GREAT GRAND ##M ##OTHER LOOK HE THOUGHT HER ALL THE MORE CHAR ##MING FOR THAT
THE VI ##OL ##INS AND HA ##UT BOYS PLAY ##ED OLD BUT EXC ##ELL ##ENT PIE ##CES OF MUS ##IC AND AFTER SUPP ##ER TO LO ##SE NO TIME THE GRAND AL ##M ##ONE ##R MAR ##RIED THE RO ##Y ##AL LOVE ##R ##S IN THE CHAP ##EL OF THE CAST ##LE
HE TURNED TO SHOW THEM THE CAST ##LE BUT BEH ##OLD
WHEN SHE SAID GOOD NIGHT TO BEEN ##IE AND WENT TO HER CH ##AM ##BER OVER THAT WHERE THE LOVED PAR ##ENT AND FRIEND WOULD FALL AS ##LE ##EP NO MORE SHE FELT AS IF SHE WENT WALK ##ING ALONG TO HER TOM ##B
AT THE TIME MARY HAD NOT ##ED NOTHING OF THESE THINGS NOW SHE SAW THEM ALL AS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MIN ##UTE DET ##AIL WHILE SLOWLY SHE WENT UP THE ST ##AIR AND THROUGH THE N ##ARR ##OWED WAY ##S AND HEARD THE SAME WIND THAT RA ##VED AL ##IKE ABOUT THE NEW GRA ##VE AND THE OLD HOUSE INTO WHICH LA ##T ##TER FOR ALL THE B ##ALE ##S BANK ##ED AGAINST THE WALL ##S IT FOUND MANY A CH ##INK OF ENT ##RA ##N ##CE
WHEN SHE OPENED THE DOOR OF IT THE BRIGHT FIRE WHICH BEEN ##IE UN ##DE ##S ##IRED HAD KIND ##LED THERE START ##LED HER THE ROOM LOOKED UN ##N ##AT ##UR ##AL UNC ##AN ##NY BECAUSE IT WAS CHE ##ER ##FUL
SHE STOOD FOR A MOMENT ON THE HEART ##H AND IN SAD DREAM ##Y MO ##OD LIST ##ENED TO THE HOW ##LING SW ##OO ##PS OF THE WIND MAKING THE HOUSE QU ##IVER AND SH ##AKE
THIS WAS HER DREAM AS NEARLY AS SHE COULD REC ##ALL IT WHEN SHE CAME TO HERSELF AFTER WA ##KING FROM IT WITH A CRY
SHE WAS ONE OF A LARGE COMPANY AT A HOUSE WHERE SHE HAD NEVER BEEN BEFORE A BEAUTIFUL HOUSE WITH A LARGE GARDEN BEHIND
IT WAS A SUM ##MER NIGHT AND THE GU ##EST ##S WERE WA ##NDER ##ING IN AND OUT AT WILL AND THROUGH HOUSE AND GARDEN AM ##ID LOVE ##LY THINGS OF ALL COL ##ORS AND O ##D ##ORS
BUT SHE KNEW NO ##BODY AND WA ##NDER ##ED ALONE IN THE GARDEN OPP ##RESSED WITH SOMETHING SHE DID NOT UNDERSTAND
AT THE END OF IT SHE WAS IN A PLACE OF TOM ##BS
SHE ENTERED AND THE SERV ##ANTS SOFT FOOT ##ED AND SIL ##ENT WERE BUS ##Y CARRY ##ING AWAY THE VE ##S ##SEL ##S OF HO ##S ##P ##IT ##ALITY AND REST ##OR ##ING ORDER AS IF ALREADY THEY PREP ##ARED FOR ANOTHER COMPANY ON THE MOR ##RO ##W NO ONE HE ##ED ##ED HER
SHE WAS LOST LOST UT ##TER ##LY WITH AN E ##TERN ##AL LO ##S ##S
SHE KNEW NOTHING OF THE PLACE HAD NOW ##HERE TO GO NOW ##HERE SHE WANTED TO GO HAD NOT A THOUGHT TO TELL HER WHAT QUESTION TO ASK IF SHE MET A LIVING SOUL
BUT LIVING SOUL THERE COULD BE NONE TO MEET
SHE HAD LOST HIM YEARS AND YEARS BEFORE AND NOW SHE SAW HIM HE WAS THERE AND SHE KNEW HIM
HE CAME TO HER SIDE AND SHE GAVE HIM NO GRE ##ET ##ING
I KNOW IT AND THERE IS NO WA ##KING
THE OLD TIME WAS BUT A THICK ##ER DREAM AND THIS IS TRUE ##R BECAUSE MORE SHAD ##OW ##Y
HER ONLY LIFE WAS THAT SHE WAS LOST
SHALL I PO ##UR OUT MY SOUL INTO THE EAR OF A MIST A F ##UM ##E FROM MY OWN BRA ##IN
THUS WAS SHE BORN ##E AWAY CAP ##T ##IVE OF HER DEAD NEITHER WILL ##ING NOR UN ##W ##ILL ##ING OF LIFE AND DEATH EQU ##ALLY CARE ##LESS
WITH THAT CAME A PA ##NG OF INT ##ENSE PAIN
SHE HERSELF SHOULD HAVE BEEN A PO ##EM A L ##Y ##RIC IN A WHITE GO ##WN AND GREEN SCAR ##F COMING TO HIM THROUGH THE LONG GRA ##S ##S UNDER THE BL ##OSS ##OME ##D BO ##UG ##H ##S
HER HANDS SHOULD HAVE BEEN FULL OF BLUE ##BE ##LL ##S AND SHE SHOULD HAVE HELD THEM UP TO HIS FACE IN MAID ##EN ##LY DEF ##ENCE AS HE SPR ##ANG FORWARD TO TAKE HER IN HIS ARMS
YOU SEE THAT SHE KNEW EXACT ##LY HOW A TRY ##ST IS COND ##UCT ##ED IN THE PA ##GE ##S OF THE STAND ##ARD PO ##ETS AND OF THE CHE ##APE ##R WEE ##K ##LY JOUR ##N ##ALS
SHE HAD TO THE FULL LIM ##IT ALL ##OWED OF HER READ ##ING AND HER EN ##V ##IR ##ON ##MENT THE LI ##TER ##ARY SENSE
AND CUR ##IOUSLY ENOUGH SHE WAS HARDLY CUR ##IOUS AT ALL ABOUT WHAT HE MIGHT HAVE TO SAY
SHE ONLY WISH ##ED FOR MAY AND THE OR ##CH ##ARD INSTEAD OF J ##AN ##U ##ARY AND THE DIN ##GY DU ##ST ##Y WAIT ##ING ROOM THE PLAIN FACE ##D PRE ##OC ##C ##UP ##IED TRA ##VEL ##LER ##S THE D ##IM DES ##OL ##ATE WE ##ATHER
THE SET ##TING OF THE SC ##ENE SEEMED TO HER ALL IMPORT ##ANT
IT WAS BIT ##TER ##LY COLD BUT THE EMB ##ANK ##MENT WAS MORE ROM ##ANT ##IC THAN A RA ##IL ##WAY CAR ##RIAGE
HE HAD BEEN LATE HE HAD OFF ##ERED NO EXC ##USE NO EXPL ##AN ##ATION
BUT HERE THE ONLY THING THAT OCC ##UR ##RED TO HER WAS TO STO ##P AND LOOK IN ONE OF THE SHO ##PS TILL HE SHOULD ASK HER WHAT SHE WAS LOOKING AT
THE KE ##EN WIND THR ##UST ITSELF EVEN INS ##IDE THE HIGH COLL ##AR OF HER J ##ACK ##ET
HER HANDS AND FEET WERE AC ##HING WITH COLD
SHE WOULD HAVE SHAR ##ED HIS SO ##R ##RO ##W AND SHOW ##N HERSELF HALF WIFE HALF ANG ##EL FROM HEAVEN IN THIS DARK HOUR
SHE SAID HOW FRIGHT ##FULLY COLD IT IS
AND YES ##TER ##DAY I HAD A LETTER FROM HER AND SHE SEEMS TO EXPECT TO THINK AND I THOUGHT I OUGHT TO TELL YOU DA ##R ##LING
A SHO ##CK OF UN ##BE ##L ##IE ##V ##ABLE REL ##IEF T ##ING ##LED THROUGH HER SO THAT WAS ALL WHAT WAS IT COMP ##ARED WITH HER FEAR ##S
WHAT OPIN ##ION WOULD HE FORM OF THE PUR ##ITY OF HER MIND THE INN ##OC ##ENCE OF HER SOUL IF AN INC ##IDENT LIKE THIS FA ##ILED TO SHO ##CK HER DEEP ##LY
FOLLOW ##ING THE T ##ING ##LE OF REL ##IEF CAME A SHAR ##P S ##ICK ##ENING P ##IN ##CH OF JE ##AL ##OUS ##Y AND MOR ##T ##IFIC ##ATION THESE INS ##P ##IRED HER
I DON ' T WONDER YOU WERE AFRAID TO TELL ME SHE BEGAN YOU DON ' T LOVE ME YOU ' VE NEVER LOVED ME I WAS AN I ##D ##I ##OT TO BELIEVE YOU DID
THOSE FOUR TRUE WORDS WO ##UND ##ED HER MORE THAN ALL THE REST
COULD ##N ' T HELP IT THEN HOW CAN I EVER TR ##UST YOU
DO YOU THINK I ' M NOT SO ##R ##RY NOW
NO IT ' S ONLY PAIN ##FUL FOR BOTH OF US
I DIDN ' T THINK A DEC ##ENT MAN COULD DO SUCH THINGS SHE WAS PULL ##ING ON HER GL ##OVE ##S GO HOME AND GL ##O ##AT OVER IT ALL
HE STOOD UP SUDDENLY DO YOU MEAN IT
ARE YOU REALLY GOING TO THR ##OW ME OVER FOR A THING LIKE THIS
AND HE STR ##OD ##E DOWN BETWEEN THE MAR ##BLE TABLE ##S AND OUT BY THE SW ##ING DOOR IT WAS A VERY GOOD EX ##IT
AT THE CORN ##ER HE REMEMBER ##ED THAT HE HAD GONE AWAY WITHOUT PAY ##ING FOR THE TE ##A AND HIS NATURAL IMP ##UL ##SE WAS TO GO BACK AND REM ##ED ##Y THAT ER ##RO ##R
HE CHE ##CK ##ED THE SIL ##LY IMP ##UL ##SE
SO HE EN ##L ##IST ##ED AND WENT TO SOUTH AF ##RIC ##A AND HE NEVER CAME HOME COVER ##ED WITH MED ##ALS AND GL ##ORY WHICH WAS RATHER HIS IDEA TO THE FEW SIM ##PLE WORDS OF EXPL ##AN ##ATION THAT WOULD HAVE MADE ALL STRAIGHT AND REP ##A ##ID HER AND HIM FOR ALL THE PAST
THE LAST STRA ##INS OF THE ILL TREAT ##ED ILL FAT ##ED INTER ##ME ##Z ##Z ##O HAD DIED AWAY AND AFTER THEM HAD DIED AWAY ALSO THE RU ##MB ##LING OF THE WH ##EE ##LS OF THE MUR ##DER ##OUS BAR ##RE ##L OR ##G ##AN THAT HAD SO G ##AIL ##Y EX ##E ##C ##UTE ##D THAT ALONG WITH THE N ##INE OTHER T ##UNE ##S OF ITS REPE ##R ##TO ##RY TO THE ADM ##IR ##ATION OF THE HOUSE ##MA ##ID AT THE WINDOW OF THE HOUSE OPP ##OS ##ITE AND THE CROW ##ING DELIGHT OF THE TWO BAB ##IES NEXT DOOR
THE YOUNG MAN DREW A DEEP BREATH OF REL ##IEF AND LIGHT ##ED THE WA ##X CAN ##DLE ##S IN THE SOL ##ID SIL ##VER CAN ##DLE ##ST ##ICK ##S ON HIS WR ##ITING TABLE FOR NOW THE LATE SUM ##MER DU ##S ##K WAS FALL ##ING AND THAT OR ##G ##AN PLEASE HEAVEN MADE FULL THE ME ##AS ##URE OF THE DAY ' S APP ##OINT ##ED TO ##R ##T ##URE
THEN THERE WAS SILENCE THEN A S ##IGH AND THE SOUND OF LIGHT MO ##VING FEET ON THE GRA ##VEL
AND AGAIN HE LIST ##ENED WITH A QUIET PLEASURE
NEVER HAD ANY ACT SEEMED SO IMPOSS ##IBLE
THERE IS A SEA ##T IN THE GARDEN AT THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE AGAIN SHE HE ##S ##IT ##ATED
THEN SHE TURNED TOWARDS THE QUAR ##TER IND ##IC ##ATED AND DISAPP ##EAR ##ED ROUND THE LA ##URE ##L BUS ##H ##ES
LOOK HERE HE SAID THIS IS ALL NO ##N ##SE ##N ##SE YOU KNOW YOU ARE T ##IRED OUT AND THERE ' S SOMETHING WRONG WHAT IS IT
DO DRINK THIS AND THEN TELL ME PERHAPS I CAN HELP YOU
HE HUR ##RIED ##LY CUT CA ##KE AND PRES ##SE ##D IT UPON HER
HE HAD NO TIME TO THINK BUT HE WAS AW ##ARE THAT THIS WAS THE MOST EXC ##ITING ADV ##ENT ##URE THAT HAD EVER HAPPENED TO HIM
IS IT ONLY THAT YOU ' RE POOR WHY THAT ' S NOTHING I ' M POOR TOO SHE LAUGH ##ED
HER LITTLE FOOT T ##APP ##ED THE GRA ##VEL IMP ##AT ##IENT ##LY
HE TOLD ME TO STAY ON AT THE HOT ##EL AND I DID AND THEN ONE NIGHT WHEN I WAS AT THE THE ##AT ##RE MY MAID A HOR ##RI ##D FRENCH THING WE GOT IN PAR ##IS PA ##CK ##ED UP ALL MY TR ##UN ##KS AND TOOK ALL MY MONEY AND PA ##ID THE BILL AND WENT
SHE SAID AGAIN YOU ARE KIND
WELL THEN I WENT INTO LO ##D ##GING ##S THAT W ##ICKED WOMAN HAD LEFT ME ONE STREET SU ##IT AND TO DAY THEY TURNED ME OUT BECAUSE MY MONEY WAS ALL GONE
LET ME THINK HE SAID OH HOW GLAD I AM THAT YOU HAPPENED TO COME THIS WAY
I SHALL LO ##CK UP ALL THE DOOR ##S AND WINDOW ##S IN THE HOUSE AND THEN I SHALL GIVE YOU MY LA ##T ##CH KE ##Y AND YOU CAN LET YOURSELF IN AND STAY THE NIGHT HERE THERE IS NO ONE IN THE HOUSE
I WILL CAT ##CH THE NIGHT TRA ##IN AND BRING MY MOTHER UP TO MOR ##RO ##W THEN WE WILL SEE WHAT CAN BE DONE
YOU SEE PAP ##A ' S SO VERY RICH AND AT HOME THEY EXPECT ME TO TO GET ACQU ##AINT ##ED WITH DU ##KE ##S AND THINGS AND SHE STOPPED
IT WAS ##N ' T I WHO SAID THAT SAID THE GIRL SM ##ILING BUT THAT ' S SO ANY ##H ##OW AND THEN SHE S ##IGH ##ED
ALL THE SAME HE ADDED IR ##RE ##LE ##V ##ANTLY YOU SHALL HAVE THE LA ##T ##CH KE ##Y
YOU ARE KIND SHE SAID FOR THE THIRD TIME AND REACHED HER HAND OUT TO HIM HE DID NOT K ##ISS IT THEN ONLY TOOK IT IN HIS AND FELT HOW SMALL AND COLD IT WAS THEN IT WAS TAKEN AWAY
THE LADY AND THE GU ##IT ##AR CERTAINLY PASSED THE NIGHT AT HILL VIEW VILL ##A BUT WHEN HIS MOTHER VERY ANG ##RY AND VERY FRIGHT ##ENED CAME UP WITH HIM AT ABOUT NO ##ON THE HOUSE LOOKED JUST AS US ##UAL AND NO ONE WAS THERE BUT THE CHAR ##W ##OM ##AN

SOME ARE WONDER ##FULLY WR ##OUGHT PRETTY LITTLE HOME ##S FOR BIRD ##I ##K ##INS
INDEED IT IS NOT A NE ##ST AT ALL ONLY THE BEGIN ##NING OF ONE
AND THERE IS AN OLD STORY ABOUT THIS WHICH I SHALL TELL YOU
OH WHAT SHALL WE DO FOR A HOME
AND THE POOR SIL ##LY THINGS RU ##FF ##LED UP THEIR FE ##ATHER ##S AND LOOKED MIS ##ER ##ABLE AS ONLY A LITTLE BIRD CAN LOOK WHEN IT IS UN ##H ##APP ##Y
SHE WAS INDEED A CLE ##VER BIRD
SHE PO ##PPED INTO HER NEW HOUSE AND SAT THERE COMFORT ##ABLY PE ##ERING OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW SL ##ITS WITH HER SHAR ##P LITTLE EYES
AND SHE SAW THE OTHER BIRD ##S HOP ##P ##ING ABOUT AND TW ##ITT ##ERING HELP ##LESS ##LY
THEN ALL THE OTHER BIRD ##S CH ##IR ##PE ##D E ##AGER ##LY YES YES LET US ASK HER TO TE ##ACH US
SO IN A GREAT COMPANY THEY CAME FL ##UT ##TER ##ING HOP ##P ##ING TW ##ITT ##ERING UP TO THE EL ##M TREE WHERE MOTHER MAG ##P ##IE NE ##ST ##LED COMFORT ##ABLY IN HER NEW HOUSE
O W ##ISE MOTHER MAG ##P ##IE DEAR MOTHER MAG ##P ##IE THEY CRIED TE ##ACH US HOW TO BUILD OUR NE ##ST ##S LIKE YOUR ##S FOR IT IS GR ##OWING NIGHT AND WE ARE T ##IRED AND SLEEP ##Y
THE MAG ##P ##IE SAID SHE WOULD TE ##ACH THEM IF THEY WOULD BE A PAT ##IENT D ##IL ##IG ##ENT OB ##ED ##IENT CLASS OF LITTLE BIRD ##S
AND WHERE EACH BIRD PER ##CHED THERE IT WAS TO BUILD ITS NE ##ST
SHE BEGAN TO SHOW THEM HOW TO WE ##AVE THE BIT ##S OF THINGS TOGETHER INTO NE ##ST ##S AS THEY SHOULD BE MADE
AND SOME OF THE BIRD ##S WHO WERE ATT ##ENT ##IVE AND CARE ##FUL SOON SAW HOW IT WAS DONE AND START ##ED N ##ICE HOME ##S FOR THEMSELVES
I THOUGHT THAT WAS THE WAY TO BEGIN
CERTAINLY OF COURSE SC ##REAM ##ED THE J ##ACK ##D ##AW
HERE WOOD P ##IG ##E ##ON SAID MOTHER MAG ##P ##IE YOU MUST PLACE THOSE ST ##ICK ##S THROUGH AND ACROSS CR ##ISS CROSS CR ##ISS CROSS SO
CR ##ISS CROSS CR ##ISS CROSS SO INTER ##RUPT ##ED THE WOOD P ##IG ##E ##ON
YOU SAY YOU KNOW ALL ABOUT IT THEN GO ON AND FIN ##ISH YOUR NE ##ST ##S BY YOUR ##SELVES

AND AWAY SHE FLE ##W TO HER OWN CO ##S ##Y NE ##ST IN THE EL ##M TREE WHERE SHE WAS SOON FAST AS ##LE ##EP FORG ##ET ##TING ALL ABOUT THE MATTER
BUT THE WOOD P ##IG ##E ##ON WAS IN THE WOR ##ST CASE OF THEM ALL
FOR SHE HAD ONLY THE FOUND ##ATION LAID CR ##ISS CROSS AS THE MAG ##P ##IE HAD SHOW ##N HER
A PERSON WOULD THINK THAT AFTER A FAMILY HAD LIVED SO LONG IN A PLACE ALL THE NEIGHB ##ORS WOULD BE FO ##ND OF THEM YET IT IS NOT SO
IT IS DIS ##GR ##ACE ##FUL
THEY THOUGHT THE TROUBLE CAME FROM BAD BRING ##ING UP OR NO BRING ##ING UP AT ALL
THEY ALWAYS AT ##E PLAIN FOOD AND PLE ##N ##TY OF IT AND THEY NEVER AT ##E BETWEEN ME ##ALS
YOU WOULD THINK THAT WITH SIX LEG ##S AP ##IE ##CE AND THREE JO ##INT ##S IN EACH LEG THEY MIGHT WALK QUITE FAST YET THEY NEVER DID
THEY DID NOT BREATH ##E IT INTO THEIR MOUTH ##S OR THROUGH GI ##LL ##S BUT TOOK IT IN THROUGH SOME OPEN ##INGS IN THE BACK PART OF THEIR BO ##D ##IES
BOTH LIPS ASKED THE LAR ##V ##A ##E
WELL OUR LOW ##ER LIPS ANY ##WAY ANSWERED THE N ##Y ##M ##PH
OUR UP ##PER LIPS ARE SO SMALL THEY DON ' T MATTER
THEY KNEW THAT WHEN ##EVER THEY ST ##UCK OUT THEIR LOW ##ER LIPS AT THE SMALL FISH ##ES AND BU ##GS THEY SW ##AM AWAY AS FAST AS THEY COULD
INDEED THE LOW ##ER LI ##P OF A DRA ##G ##ON FL ##Y CHILD MIGHT WELL FRIGHT ##EN PEOPLE FOR IT IS FAST ##ENED ON A LONG JO ##INT ##ED ARM LIKE THING AND HAS P ##INCE ##R ##S ON IT WITH WHICH IT CAT ##CHES AND HOLD ##S ITS FOOD

HERE COMES THE SN ##APP ##ING T ##UR ##TLE

THEY THOUGHT HE MIGHT BE GOING TO TAKE A N ##AP AFTER HIS DINNER
HE BEGAN TO DRAW IN HIS LEG ##S VERY VERY SLOWLY AND JUST AS HIS GREAT HARD LOW ##ER SHE ##LL TOU ##CHED THE MU ##D THE LAST LAR ##V ##A CRA ##W ##LED OUT UNDER HIS T ##AIL

WHEN SHE RETURNED HIS HAND WAS ST ##ICK ##ING THROUGH THE HO ##LE IN THE DOOR
THE CR ##IES AND CUR ##SE ##S OF THE ROB ##BER ##S FILLED THE AIR
