IF EVER HE WAS IMP ##ELL ##ED TO CAST S ##IN FROM HIM AND TO REPE ##N ##T THE IMP ##UL ##SE THAT MOVE ##D HIM WAS THE WISH TO BE HER KNIGHT
HE TRIED TO THINK HOW IT COULD BE
BUT THE DU ##S ##K DEEP ##ENING IN THE SCHOOL ##RO ##OM COVER ##ED OVER HIS THOUGHTS THE BELL RAN ##G

STEP ##H ##EN LEA ##NING BACK AND DRAW ##ING I ##D ##LY ON HIS SC ##RIB ##BLE ##R LIST ##ENED TO THE TALK ABOUT HIM WHICH HER ##ON CHE ##CK ##ED FROM TIME TO TIME BY SAYING

A GENTLE K ##ICK FROM THE T ##ALL BOY IN THE BE ##N ##CH BEHIND U ##R ##GED STEP ##H ##EN TO ASK A DIFFIC ##ULT QUESTION
THE REC ##TO ##R DID NOT ASK FOR A CAT ##E ##CH ##ISM TO HEAR THE LESS ##ON FROM

HE HAD THE FAITH IN HIM THAT MOVE ##S MOUNTAIN ##S
A GREAT SAINT SAINT FR ##AN ##CI ##S X ##AV ##IER
IN THE SILENCE THEIR DARK FIRE KIND ##LED THE DU ##S ##K INTO A T ##AW ##NY GL ##OW
HE COULD WAIT NO LONGER

HE SET OFF AB ##RUPT ##LY FOR THE BU ##LL WALK ##ING RAP ##ID ##LY LE ##ST HIS FATHER ' S SH ##RI ##LL WHIS ##TLE MIGHT CALL HIM BACK AND IN A FEW MOMENT ##S HE HAD ROUND ##ED THE CUR ##VE AT THE POL ##ICE BAR ##RA ##CK AND WAS SA ##FE

THE PR ##IDE OF THAT D ##IM IMAG ##E BROUGHT BACK TO HIS MIND THE D ##IGN ##ITY OF THE OFFIC ##E HE HAD REF ##USED

THE UNC ##OUTH FACE ##S PASSED HIM TWO BY TWO ST ##AINED YE ##LLOW OR RED OR LI ##V ##ID BY THE SEA AND AS HE STR ##OVE TO LOOK AT THEM WITH EAS ##E AND IND ##IFF ##ERE ##N ##CE A FA ##INT ST ##AIN OF PERSON ##AL SH ##AME AND COMM ##ISE ##RA ##T ##ION ROSE TO HIS OWN FACE

IT WAS I ##DLE FOR HIM TO MOVE HIMSELF TO BE GENER ##OUS TOWARDS THEM TO TELL HIMSELF THAT IF HE EVER CAME TO THEIR G ##ATES STRI ##PPED OF HIS PR ##IDE BE ##ATE ##N AND IN BEG ##GAR ' S WEE ##D ##S THAT THEY WOULD BE GENER ##OUS TOWARDS HIM LO ##VING HIM AS THEMSELVES

AGAIN AGAIN
A VOICE FROM BEYOND THE WORLD WAS CALL ##ING

IT WAS A PAIN TO SEE THEM AND A SW ##ORD LIKE PAIN TO SEE THE SIGN ##S OF AD ##OL ##ES ##CE ##N ##CE THAT MADE REPE ##LL ##ENT THEIR P ##IT ##IA ##BLE N ##AKE ##D ##NESS
STEP ##H ##AN ##OS DE ##D ##AL ##OS
A MOMENT BEFORE THE G ##H ##OST OF THE AN ##CIENT KING ##D ##OM OF THE DA ##NE ##S HAD LOOKED FORTH THROUGH THE VE ##ST ##URE OF THE HA ##Z ##EW ##RA ##PPED CITY
YOU WILL FIND ME CONTIN ##UALLY SPEAK ##ING OF FOUR MEN T ##IT ##IAN HO ##L ##BE ##IN TURN ##ER AND T ##INT ##ORE ##T IN ALMOST THE SAME TER ##MS
THEY UN ##ITE EVERY QU ##ALITY AND SOMETIMES YOU WILL FIND ME REF ##ER ##RI ##NG TO THEM AS COL ##OR ##ISTS SOMETIMES AS CH ##IAR ##OS ##C ##UR ##ISTS
BY BEING STUD ##IOUS OF COL ##OR THEY ARE STUD ##IOUS OF DIV ##IS ##ION AND WHILE THE CH ##IAR ##OS ##C ##UR ##IST DEV ##OTE ##S HIMSELF TO THE REP ##RES ##ENT ##ATION OF DE ##GR ##EE ##S OF FORCE IN ONE THING UN ##SE ##PAR ##ATED LIGHT THE COL ##OR ##ISTS HAVE FOR THEIR F ##UN ##CTION THE ATT ##AIN ##MENT OF BEAUTY BY ARR ##ANGE ##MENT OF THE DIV ##IS ##IONS OF LIGHT
MY FIRST AND PRINCI ##P ##AL REASON WAS THAT THEY EN ##F ##OR ##CED BEYOND ALL RES ##IST ##ANCE ON ANY STUD ##ENT WHO MIGHT ATTEMPT TO CO ##P ##Y THEM THIS MET ##H ##OD OF LAY ##ING PORT ##IONS OF DIST ##INCT H ##UE SIDE BY SIDE
SOME OF THE TOU ##CHES INDEED WHEN THE T ##INT HAS BEEN M ##IX ##ED WITH MUCH WATER HAVE BEEN LAID IN LITTLE DRO ##PS OR PO ##ND ##S SO THAT THE P ##IG ##MENT MIGHT CRY ##ST ##ALL ##IZE HARD AT THE ED ##GE
IT IS THE HEAD OF A PAR ##RO ##T WITH A LITTLE FLO ##W ##ER IN HIS BE ##AK FROM A PICT ##URE OF CAR ##P ##AC ##CI ##O ' S ONE OF HIS SER ##IES OF THE LIFE OF SAINT GE ##OR ##GE
THEN HE COMES TO THE BE ##AK OF IT
THE BROWN GROUND BENE ##ATH IS LEFT FOR THE MOST PART ONE TOU ##CH OF BLACK IS PUT FOR THE HO ##LLOW TWO DEL ##IC ##ATE LINE ##S OF DARK GRA ##Y DEF ##INE THE OUT ##ER CUR ##VE AND ONE LITTLE QU ##IVER ##ING TOU ##CH OF WHITE DRAW ##S THE INN ##ER ED ##GE OF THE MAN ##D ##IBLE
FOR BELIEVE ME THE FIN ##AL PHIL ##OS ##OP ##H ##Y OF ART CAN ONLY RA ##T ##IF ##Y THEIR OPIN ##ION THAT THE BEAUTY OF A CO ##CK ROB ##IN IS TO BE RED AND OF A GRA ##S ##S PL ##OT TO BE GREEN AND THE BEST SK ##ILL OF ART IS IN INST ##ANTLY SE ##IZ ##ING ON THE MAN ##IF ##OLD DEL ##IC ##IOUS ##NESS OF LIGHT WHICH YOU CAN ONLY SE ##IZE BY PRE ##CI ##S ##ION OF INST ##ANT ##ANE ##OUS TOU ##CH
NOW YOU WILL SEE IN THESE STUD ##IES THAT THE MOMENT THE WHITE IS INCL ##OSED PROPER ##LY AND HAR ##M ##ON ##IZED WITH THE OTHER H ##UES IT BECOME ##S SOME ##H ##OW MORE PRE ##CIOUS AND PE ##AR ##LY THAN THE WHITE PAPER AND THAT I AM NOT AFRAID TO LEAVE A WHOLE FIELD OF UNT ##REAT ##ED WHITE PAPER ALL ROUND IT BEING SURE THAT EVEN THE LITTLE D ##IAM ##OND ##S IN THE ROUND WINDOW WILL TELL AS JE ##W ##ELS IF THEY ARE GRA ##D ##ATED JUST ##LY
BUT IN THIS VI ##GN ##ET ##TE CO ##P ##IED FROM TURN ##ER YOU HAVE THE TWO PRINCI ##PLE ##S BROUGHT OUT PERFECT ##LY
THEY ARE BEYOND ALL OTHER WORK ##S THAT I KNOW EXIST ##ING DEP ##END ##ENT FOR THEIR EFFECT ON LOW SUB ##DU ##ED TONE ##S THEIR FAV ##OR ##ITE CH ##O ##ICE IN TIME OF DAY BEING EITHER DA ##WN OR TW ##IL ##IGHT AND EVEN THEIR BRIGHT ##EST SUN ##SE ##TS PRODU ##CED CHIEF ##LY OUT OF GRA ##Y PAPER
IT MAY BE THAT A GREAT COL ##OR ##IST WILL USE HIS UT ##MOST FORCE OF COL ##OR AS A SING ##ER HIS FULL POWER OF VOICE BUT LO ##UD OR LOW THE VI ##R ##T ##UE IS IN BOTH CASE ##S ALWAYS IN REF ##INE ##MENT NEVER IN LO ##UD ##NESS
IT MUST REMEMBER BE ONE OR THE OTHER
DO NOT THEREFORE THINK THAT THE GOT ##H ##IC SCHOOL IS AN EAS ##Y ONE
THE LAW OF THAT SCHOOL IS THAT EVERYTHING SHALL BE SEEN CLEAR ##LY OR AT LEAST ONLY IN SUCH MIST OR FA ##INT ##NESS AS SHALL BE DELIGHT ##FUL AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT THE BEST INT ##RO ##DU ##CTION TO IT WOULD BE THE ELE ##MENT ##ARY PRACT ##ICE OF PAIN ##TING EVERY STUD ##Y ON A GOLD ##EN GROUND
THIS AT ONCE COMP ##ELS YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE WORK IS TO BE IMAG ##IN ##ATIVE AND DEC ##OR ##ATIVE THAT IT REP ##RES ##ENTS BEAUTIFUL THINGS IN THE CLEAR ##EST WAY BUT NOT UNDER EXIST ##ING COND ##ITION ##S AND THAT IN FACT YOU ARE PRODU ##CING JE ##W ##EL ##ER ' S WORK RATHER THAN PICT ##URES
THAT A ST ##Y ##LE IS REST ##RA ##INED OR SEVER ##E DOES NOT MEAN THAT IT IS ALSO ER ##RO ##NE ##OUS
IN ALL EARLY GOT ##H ##IC ART INDEED YOU WILL FIND FA ##IL ##URE OF THIS KIND ES ##PE ##CI ##ALLY DIST ##ORT ##ION AND R ##IG ##ID ##ITY WHICH ARE IN MANY RESPECT ##S PAIN ##FULLY TO BE COMP ##ARED WITH THE SP ##LE ##ND ##ID REP ##OSE OF CLASS ##IC ART
THE LARGE LETTER CONT ##AINS INDEED ENTIRE ##LY FE ##E ##BLE AND ILL DRAW ##N FIG ##URES THAT IS MERE ##LY CHILD ##ISH AND FA ##ILING WORK OF AN INF ##ER ##IOR HAND IT IS NOT CHARACTER ##IST ##IC OF GOT ##H ##IC OR ANY OTHER SCHOOL
BUT OBSER ##VE YOU CAN ONLY DO THIS ON ONE COND ##ITION THAT OF STRI ##VING ALSO TO CREAT ##E IN REAL ##ITY THE BEAUTY WHICH YOU SEE ##K IN IMAG ##INATION
IT WILL BE WHO ##LLY IMPOSS ##IBLE FOR YOU TO RET ##AIN THE TRA ##N ##QU ##ILL ##ITY OF TEM ##PER AND FE ##LIC ##ITY OF FAITH NECESSARY FOR NO ##BLE PUR ##IST PAIN ##TING UN ##LESS YOU ARE ACT ##IVE ##LY ENG ##AGED IN PROM ##OT ##ING THE FE ##LIC ##ITY AND PEACE OF PRACT ##ICAL LIFE
YOU MUST LOOK AT HIM IN THE FACE FIGHT HIM CON ##QU ##ER HIM WITH WHAT SC ##ATH ##E YOU MAY YOU NEED NOT THINK TO KEEP OUT OF THE WAY OF HIM
THE COL ##OR ##IST SAYS FIRST OF ALL AS MY DEL ##IC ##IOUS PAR ##O ##QU ##ET WAS RU ##BY SO THIS N ##AST ##Y VI ##PER SHALL BE BLACK AND THEN IS THE QUESTION CAN I ROUND HIM OFF EVEN THOUGH HE IS BLACK AND MAKE HIM SL ##IM ##Y AND YET SPR ##ING ##Y AND CLOSE DOWN CL ##OTT ##ED LIKE A PO ##OL OF BLACK BLOOD ON THE EARTH ALL THE SAME
NOTHING WILL BE MORE PRE ##CIOUS TO YOU I THINK IN THE PRACT ##ICAL STUD ##Y OF ART THAN THE CONV ##ICT ##ION WHICH WILL FORCE ITSELF ON YOU MORE AND MORE EVERY HOUR OF THE WAY ALL THINGS ARE BOUND TOGETHER LITTLE AND GREAT IN SPIRIT AND IN MATTER
YOU KNOW I HAVE JUST BEEN TELL ##ING YOU HOW THIS SCHOOL OF MAT ##ER ##IAL ##ISM AND CL ##AY INV ##OL ##VED ITSELF AT LAST IN CL ##OUD AND FIRE

IT WAS THIS OBSER ##V ##ATION THAT DREW FROM DO ##UG ##LA ##S NOT IMMEDIATELY BUT LATER IN THE EVENING A REP ##LY THAT HAD THE INTEREST ##ING CONSE ##QU ##ENCE TO WHICH I CALL ATTENTION
SOME ##ONE ELSE TOLD A STORY NOT PARTICULAR ##LY EFFECT ##IVE WHICH I SAW HE WAS NOT FOLLOW ##ING
CRIED ONE OF THE WOMEN HE TOOK NO NOT ##ICE OF HER HE LOOKED AT ME BUT AS IF INSTEAD OF ME HE SAW WHAT HE SPOKE OF
THERE WAS A UN ##AN ##IM ##OUS GR ##O ##AN AT THIS AND MUCH REP ##RO ##ACH AFTER WHICH IN HIS PRE ##OC ##C ##UP ##IED WAY HE EXPL ##AINED
THE STORY ' S WR ##ITT ##EN
I COULD WR ##ITE TO MY MAN AND ENC ##L ##OSE THE KE ##Y HE COULD SEND DOWN THE PA ##CK ##ET AS HE FIND ##S IT

HE HUNG FIRE AGAIN A WOMAN ' S
SHE HAS BEEN DEAD THESE TWENTY YEARS
SHE SENT ME THE PA ##GE ##S IN QUESTION BEFORE SHE DIED
SHE WAS THE MOST AG ##REE ##ABLE WOMAN I ' VE EVER KNOWN IN HER POSITION SHE WOULD HAVE BEEN WORTH ##Y OF ANY WHATEVER
IT WAS ##N ' T SIM ##PLY THAT SHE SAID SO BUT THAT I KNEW SHE HAD ##N ' T I WAS SURE I COULD SEE
YOU ' LL EAS ##ILY JUD ##GE WHY WHEN YOU HEAR BECAUSE THE THING HAD BEEN SUCH A SCAR ##E HE CONTINUED TO FIX ME
YOU ARE AC ##UTE
HE QU ##ITTED THE FIRE AND DRO ##PPED BACK INTO HIS CHAIR
PROB ##ABLY NOT TILL THE SECOND POST
IT WAS ALMOST THE TONE OF HOPE EVERY ##BODY WILL STAY
CRIED THE LAD ##IES WHOSE DEP ##ART ##URE HAD BEEN FIX ##ED
MISSUS GR ##IFF ##IN HOWEVER EXPRESS ##ED THE NEED FOR A LITTLE MORE LIGHT
WHO WAS IT SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH THE STORY WILL TELL I TOOK UPON MYSELF TO REP ##LY OH I CAN ' T WAIT FOR THE STORY THE STORY WON ' T TELL SAID DO ##UG ##LA ##S NOT IN ANY LI ##TER ##AL V ##UL ##GAR WAY MORE ' S THE P ##ITY THEN
WON ' T YOU TELL DO ##UG ##LA ##S
WELL IF I DON ' T KNOW WHO SHE WAS IN LOVE WITH I KNOW WHO HE WAS
LET ME SAY HERE DIST ##INCT ##LY TO HAVE DONE WITH IT THAT THIS N ##ARR ##ATIVE FROM AN EXACT TRANS ##CRI ##PT OF MY OWN MADE MUCH LATER IS WHAT I SHALL PRESENT ##LY GIVE
POOR DO ##UG ##LA ##S BEFORE HIS DEATH WHEN IT WAS IN SIGHT COMM ##ITTED TO ME THE MAN ##US ##CRI ##PT THAT REACHED HIM ON THE THIRD OF THESE DAYS AND THAT ON THE SAME SP ##OT WITH IM ##MEN ##SE EFFECT HE BEGAN TO READ TO OUR HUS ##H ##ED LITTLE CIRC ##LE ON THE NIGHT OF THE FOUR ##TH

THE FIRST OF THESE TOU ##CHES CONV ##EY ##ED THAT THE WR ##ITT ##EN STATE ##MENT TOOK UP THE T ##ALE AT A POINT AFTER IT HAD IN A MANNER BEG ##UN
HE HAD FOR HIS OWN TOWN RES ##IDENCE A BIG HOUSE FILLED WITH THE SP ##O ##ILS OF TRA ##VEL AND THE TR ##OP ##H ##IES OF THE CH ##ASE BUT IT WAS TO HIS COUNTRY HOME AN OLD FAMILY PLACE IN ES ##SE ##X THAT HE WISH ##ED HER IMMEDIATELY TO PRO ##CEED
THE AW ##K ##WARD THING WAS THAT THEY HAD PRACT ##ICALLY NO OTHER REL ##ATIONS AND THAT HIS OWN AFF ##AIRS TOOK UP ALL HIS TIME
THERE WERE PLE ##N ##TY OF PEOPLE TO HELP BUT OF COURSE THE YOUNG LADY WHO SHOULD GO DOWN AS GOVERN ##ESS WOULD BE IN SU ##PR ##EM ##E AUTHOR ##ITY
I DON ' T AN ##T ##IC ##IP ##ATE
SHE WAS YOUNG UNT ##RIED NE ##R ##V ##OUS IT WAS A VIS ##ION OF SER ##IOUS DUT ##IES AND LITTLE COMPANY OF REALLY GREAT LO ##NE ##L ##INESS

IT WAS THE BEAUTY OF IT
IT SOUND ##ED DU ##LL IT SOUND ##ED STRANGE AND ALL THE MORE SO BECAUSE OF HIS MAIN COND ##ITION WHICH WAS

HOW STRANGE IT SEEMED TO THE SAD WOMAN AS SHE WATCH ##ED THE GR ##OW ##TH AND THE BEAUTY THAT BECAME EVERY DAY MORE BR ##ILL ##IAN ##T AND THE INTELL ##IG ##ENCE THAT THR ##EW ITS QU ##IVER ##ING SUN ##SH ##INE OVER THE T ##IN ##Y FE ##AT ##URES OF THIS CHILD

THIS OUT ##WARD MU ##T ##AB ##ILITY IND ##IC ##ATED AND DID NOT MORE THAN FAIR ##LY EXPRESS THE VAR ##IOUS PROPER ##T ##IES OF HER INN ##ER LIFE

IT TAKE ##S ME SEVERAL YEARS TO MAKE THIS MAG ##IC PO ##W ##DER BUT AT THIS MOMENT I AM PLEASE ##D TO SAY IT IS NEARLY DONE YOU SEE I AM MAKING IT FOR MY GOOD WIFE MAR ##G ##OL ##OTT ##E WHO WANT ##S TO USE SOME OF IT FOR A PURPOSE OF HER OWN
YOU MUST KNOW SAID MAR ##G ##OL ##OTT ##E WHEN THEY WERE ALL SEA ##TED TOGETHER ON THE BR ##O ##AD WINDOW SEA ##T THAT MY HUSBAND FOOL ##ISH ##LY GAVE AWAY ALL THE PO ##W ##DER OF LIFE HE FIRST MADE TO OLD MOM ##B ##I THE W ##ITCH WHO USED TO LIVE IN THE COUNTRY OF THE GI ##LL ##I ##K ##INS TO THE NORTH OF HERE
THE FIRST LO ##T WE TE ##ST ##ED ON OUR GLASS CAT WHICH NOT ONLY BEGAN TO LIVE BUT HAS LIVED EVER SINCE
I THINK THE NEXT GLASS CAT THE MAG ##IC ##IAN MAKES WILL HAVE NEITHER BRA ##INS NOR HEART FOR THEN IT WILL NOT OBJECT TO CAT ##CHING M ##ICE AND MAY PROV ##E OF SOME USE TO US
I ' M AFRAID I DON ' T KNOW MUCH ABOUT THE LAND OF O ##Z
YOU SEE I ' VE LIVED ALL MY LIFE WITH UNC N ##UN ##K ##IE THE SIL ##ENT ONE AND THERE WAS NO ONE TO TELL ME ANYTHING
THAT IS ONE REASON YOU ARE O ##J ##O THE UN ##L ##UCK ##Y SAID THE WOMAN IN A SY ##M ##P ##ATH ##ET ##IC TONE

YET THAT T ##ASK WAS NOT SO EAS ##Y AS YOU MAY SUPPOSE
A BED QU ##ILT MADE OF PAT ##CHES OF DIFFERENT KIND ##S AND COL ##ORS OF CLOTH ALL NE ##AT ##LY SE ##W ##ED TOGETHER
SOMETIMES IT IS CALLED A CRA ##Z ##Y QU ##ILT BECAUSE THE PAT ##CHES AND COL ##ORS ARE SO M ##IX ##ED UP

O ##J ##O EXAM ##INED THIS CUR ##IOUS CONTR ##IV ##ANCE WITH WONDER
MAR ##G ##OL ##OTT ##E HAD FIRST MADE THE GIRL ' S FORM FROM THE PAT ##CH ##W ##OR ##K QU ##ILT AND THEN SHE HAD DRESS ##ED IT WITH A PAT ##CH ##W ##OR ##K SK ##IRT AND AN AP ##RO ##N WITH POCK ##ETS IN IT US ##ING THE SAME G ##AY MAT ##ER ##IAL THROUGH ##OUT
THE HEAD OF THE PAT ##CH ##W ##OR ##K GIRL WAS THE MOST CUR ##IOUS PART OF HER
THE HAIR WAS OF BROWN Y ##AR ##N AND HUNG DOWN ON HER NE ##CK IN SEVERAL NE ##AT BRA ##ID ##S
GOLD IS THE MOST COMMON MET ##AL IN THE LAND OF O ##Z AND IS USED FOR MANY PURPOSE ##S BECAUSE IT IS SOFT AND PL ##IA ##BLE
NO I FORGOT ALL ABOUT THE BRA ##INS EXCLAIMED THE WOMAN
WELL THAT MAY BE TRUE AG ##REE ##D MAR ##G ##OL ##OTT ##E BUT ON THE CONTR ##ARY A SERV ##ANT WITH TOO MUCH BRA ##INS IS SURE TO BECOME INDE ##PEND ##ENT AND HIGH AND MIGHT ##Y AND FEEL ABOVE HER WORK
SHE PO ##URED INTO THE DIS ##H A QU ##ANT ##ITY FROM EACH OF THESE BO ##T ##TLE ##S
I THINK THAT WILL DO SHE CONTINUED FOR THE OTHER QU ##AL ##ITIES ARE NOT NEED ##ED IN A SERV ##ANT
SHE RAN TO HER HUSBAND ' S SIDE AT ONCE AND HELP ##ED HIM LI ##FT THE FOUR KE ##T ##TLE ##S FROM THE FIRE

NO ONE SAW HIM DO THIS FOR ALL WERE LOOKING AT THE PO ##W ##DER OF LIFE BUT SOON THE WOMAN REMEMBER ##ED WHAT SHE HAD BEEN DOING AND CAME BACK TO THE C ##UP ##BO ##ARD
O ##J ##O BECAME A BIT UN ##E ##AS ##Y AT THIS FOR HE HAD ALREADY PUT QUITE A LO ##T OF THE CLE ##VERN ##ESS PO ##W ##DER IN THE DIS ##H BUT HE DA ##RED NOT INTER ##FE ##RE AND SO HE COMFORT ##ED HIMSELF WITH THE THOUGHT THAT ONE CANNOT HAVE TOO MUCH CLE ##VERN ##ESS
HE SE ##LE ##CTED A SMALL GOLD BO ##T ##TLE WITH A PE ##PPER BOX TOP SO THAT THE PO ##W ##DER MIGHT BE SPR ##INK ##LED ON ANY OBJECT THROUGH THE SMALL HO ##LES
MOST PEOPLE TALK TOO MUCH SO IT IS A REL ##IEF TO FIND ONE WHO TALK ##S TOO LITTLE

KEEP SIL ##ENT AS LONG AS MAY BE AND IT WOULD BE W ##ISE WHEN YOU DO SPEAK TO BREAK OUT SUDDENLY IN ONE OF YOUR SHO ##UT ##INGS WHICH WILL SERV ##E TO REM ##IND THE IND ##IANS THAT YOU ARE NOT AL ##TO ##GETHER AS RES ##P ##ONS ##IBLE AS MEN SHOULD BE
IF HOWEVER THEY TAKE YOUR SC ##AL ##P AS I TR ##UST AND BELIEVE THEY WILL NOT DEP ##END ON IT UNC ##AS AND I WILL NOT FORG ##ET THE DE ##ED BUT REV ##ENG ##E IT AS BECOME ##S TRUE WAR ##RI ##ORS AND TR ##UST ##Y FRIENDS
HOLD SAID DA ##V ##ID PER ##CEI ##VING THAT WITH THIS ASS ##UR ##ANCE THEY WERE ABOUT TO LEAVE HIM I AM AN UN ##W ##ORT ##H ##Y AND HUM ##BLE FOLLOW ##ER OF ONE WHO T ##AUGHT NOT THE DA ##M ##N ##ABLE PRINCI ##PLE OF REV ##ENG ##E
THEN HEAV ##ING A HEAVY S ##IGH PROB ##ABLY AMONG THE LAST HE EVER DREW IN P ##INING FOR A COND ##ITION HE HAD SO LONG AB ##AND ##ONE ##D HE ADDED IT IS WHAT I WOULD WISH TO PRACT ##ISE MYSELF AS ONE WITHOUT A CROSS OF BLOOD THOUGH IT IS NOT ALWAYS EAS ##Y TO DEAL WITH AN IND ##IAN AS YOU WOULD WITH A FELLOW CHRIST ##IAN
GOD BL ##ESS YOU FRIEND I DO BELIEVE YOUR SC ##ENT IS NOT GREAT ##LY WRONG WHEN THE MATTER IS DU ##LY CONSIDER ##ED AND KEEP ##ING E ##TERN ##ITY BEFORE THE EYES THOUGH MUCH DEP ##END ##S ON THE NATURAL GI ##FT ##S AND THE FORCE OF TEM ##PT ##ATION
THE DEL ##AW ##ARE DOG HE SAID LEA ##NING FORWARD AND PE ##ERING THROUGH THE D ##IM LIGHT TO CAT ##CH THE EXPRESS ##ION OF THE OTHER ' S FE ##AT ##URES IS HE AFRAID
WILL THE HUR ##ONS HEAR HIS GR ##O ##ANS
THE MO ##H ##IC ##AN START ##ED ON HIS FEET AND SHO ##OK HIS SH ##AG ##GY COVER ##ING AS THOUGH THE ANIM ##AL HE COUNT ##ER ##FE ##ITED WAS ABOUT TO MAKE SOME DESP ##ER ##ATE EFF ##ORT
HE HAD NO OCCASION TO DEL ##AY FOR AT THE NEXT INST ##ANT A BUR ##ST OF CR ##IES FILLED THE OUT ##ER AIR AND RAN ALONG THE WHOLE EXT ##ENT OF THE VILL ##AGE
UNC ##AS CAST HIS SK ##IN AND STEP ##PE ##D FORTH IN HIS OWN BEAUTIFUL PROP ##ORT ##IONS
I WILL END ##E ##AV ##OUR IN MY STATE ##MENT TO AV ##O ##ID SUCH TER ##MS AS WOULD SERV ##E TO LIM ##IT THE EVEN ##TS TO ANY PARTICULAR PLACE OR GIVE A CL ##UE AS TO THE PEOPLE CONCER ##NED
I HAD ALWAYS KNOWN HIM TO BE REST ##LESS IN HIS MANNER BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR OCCASION HE WAS IN SUCH A STATE OF UNC ##ONT ##RO ##LL ##ABLE AG ##IT ##ATION THAT IT WAS CLEAR SOMETHING VERY UN ##US ##UAL HAD OCC ##UR ##RED
MY FRIEND ' S TEM ##PER HAD NOT IMP ##RO ##VED SINCE HE HAD BEEN DEP ##RI ##VED OF THE CON ##GE ##N ##IAL SUR ##RO ##UND ##INGS OF B ##AKE ##R STREET
WITHOUT HIS SC ##RA ##P ##BO ##OK ##S HIS CHE ##M ##ICAL ##S AND HIS HOME ##LY UNT ##ID ##INESS HE WAS AN UNC ##OM ##FORT ##ABLE MAN
I HAD TO READ IT OVER CARE ##FULLY AS THE TE ##XT MUST BE ABS ##OL ##UTE ##LY COR ##RE ##CT
I WAS ABS ##ENT RATHER MORE THAN AN HOUR
THE ONLY DU ##PL ##IC ##ATE WHICH EXIST ##ED SO FAR AS I KNEW WAS THAT WHICH BELONG ##ED TO MY SERV ##ANT B ##AN ##N ##ISTER A MAN WHO HAS LOOKED AFTER MY ROOM FOR TEN YEARS AND WHOSE HON ##EST ##Y IS ABS ##OL ##UTE ##LY ABOVE SUS ##P ##IC ##ION
THE MOMENT I LOOKED AT MY TABLE I WAS AW ##ARE THAT SOME ##ONE HAD RU ##M ##MA ##GED AMONG MY PAPER ##S
THE PRO ##O ##F WAS IN THREE LONG SL ##IP ##S I HAD LEFT THEM ALL TOGETHER
THE AL ##TERN ##ATIVE WAS THAT SOME ##ONE PASS ##ING HAD OBSER ##VED THE KE ##Y IN THE DOOR HAD KNOWN THAT I WAS OUT AND HAD ENTERED TO LOOK AT THE PAPER ##S
I GAVE HIM A LITTLE BRA ##ND ##Y AND LEFT HIM COLL ##APS ##ED IN A CHAIR WHILE I MADE A MOST CARE ##FUL EXAM ##INATION OF THE ROOM
A BR ##OKEN T ##IP OF LEAD WAS L ##YING THERE ALSO
NOT ONLY THIS BUT ON THE TABLE I FOUND A SMALL B ##ALL OF BLACK DO ##UG ##H OR CL ##AY WITH SPE ##CK ##S OF SOMETHING WHICH LOOK ##S LIKE SAW ##DU ##ST IN IT
ABOVE ALL THINGS I DESIRE TO SET ##TLE THE MATTER QUIET ##LY AND DISC ##REE ##T ##LY
TO THE BEST OF MY BELIE ##F THEY WERE RO ##LLED UP
DID ANY ##ONE KNOW THAT THESE PRO ##O ##F ##S WOULD BE THERE NO ONE SAVE THE PRIN ##TER
I WAS IN SUCH A HUR ##RY TO COME TO YOU YOU LEFT YOUR DOOR OPEN
SO IT SEEMS TO ME
NOW MISTER SO ##AMES AT YOUR DISP ##OS ##AL
ABOVE WERE THREE STUD ##ENTS ONE ON EACH STORY
THEN HE APPROACH ##ED IT AND STANDING ON T ##IP ##TO ##E WITH HIS NE ##CK CRA ##NED HE LOOKED INTO THE ROOM
THERE IS NO OPEN ##ING EXCEPT THE ONE PA ##NE SAID OUR LEAR ##NED GU ##IDE
I AM AFRAID THERE ARE NO SIGN ##S HERE SAID HE
ONE COULD HARDLY HOPE FOR ANY UPON SO DR ##Y A DAY
YOU LEFT HIM IN A CHAIR YOU SAY WHICH CHAIR BY THE WINDOW THERE
THE MAN ENTERED AND TOOK THE PAPER ##S SHE ##ET BY SHE ##ET FROM THE CENT ##RA ##L TABLE
AS A MATTER OF FACT HE COULD NOT SAID SO ##AMES FOR I ENTERED BY THE SIDE DOOR
HOW LONG WOULD IT TAKE HIM TO DO THAT US ##ING EVERY POSSIBLE CONTR ##ACT ##ION A QUAR ##TER OF AN HOUR NOT LESS
THEN HE TO ##S ##SE ##D IT DOWN AND SE ##IZED THE NEXT
HE WAS IN THE MID ##ST OF THAT WHEN YOUR RETURN CAUSE ##D HIM TO MAKE A VERY HUR ##RIED RET ##REAT VERY HUR ##RIED SINCE HE HAD NOT TIME TO REP ##LA ##CE THE PAPER ##S WHICH WOULD TELL YOU THAT HE HAD BEEN THERE
MISTER SO ##AMES WAS SOME ##WH ##AT OVER ##WH ##EL ##MED BY THIS FLO ##OD OF INFORM ##ATION
HO ##L ##ME ##S HELD OUT A SMALL CH ##IP WITH THE LETTER ##S N N AND A SP ##ACE OF CLEAR WOOD AFTER THEM YOU SEE
WAT ##SON I HAVE ALWAYS DONE YOU AN IN ##J ##UST ##ICE THERE ARE OTHERS
I WAS HOP ##ING THAT IF THE PAPER ON WHICH HE WR ##OTE WAS TH ##IN SOME TRA ##CE OF IT MIGHT COME THROUGH UPON THIS POL ##ISHED SUR ##F ##ACE NO I SEE NOTHING
AS HO ##L ##ME ##S DREW THE CUR ##TAIN I WAS AW ##ARE FROM SOME LITTLE R ##IG ##ID ##ITY AND AL ##ERT ##NESS OF HIS ATT ##ITUDE THAT HE WAS PREP ##ARED FOR AN EM ##ER ##GE ##N ##CY
HO ##L ##ME ##S TURNED AWAY AND STO ##OP ##ED SUDDENLY TO THE FLOOR HALL ##O ##A WHAT ' S THIS
HO ##L ##ME ##S HELD IT OUT ON HIS OPEN PAL ##M IN THE GL ##ARE OF THE ELE ##CT ##RIC LIGHT
WHAT COULD HE DO HE CAUGHT UP EVERYTHING WHICH WOULD BET ##RA ##Y HIM AND HE RU ##SH ##ED INTO YOUR BED ##RO ##OM TO CON ##CE ##AL HIMSELF
I UNDERSTAND YOU TO SAY THAT THERE ARE THREE STUD ##ENTS WHO USE THIS ST ##AIR AND ARE IN THE HA ##BIT OF PASS ##ING YOUR DOOR YES THERE ARE
AND THEY ARE ALL IN FOR THIS EXAM ##INATION YES
ONE HARDLY LIKE ##S TO THR ##OW SUS ##P ##IC ##ION WHERE THERE ARE NO PRO ##O ##F ##S
LET US HEAR THE SUS ##P ##IC ##IONS I WILL LOOK AFTER THE PRO ##O ##F ##S
MY SCH ##OL ##AR HAS BEEN LEFT VERY POOR BUT HE IS HARD WORK ##ING AND IND ##UST ##RI ##OUS HE WILL DO WELL
THE TOP FLOOR BELONG ##S TO MILES M ##C LAR ##EN
I DA ##RE NOT GO SO FAR AS THAT BUT OF THE THREE HE IS PERHAPS THE LEAST UN ##L ##IKE ##LY
HE WAS STILL SUFF ##ERING FROM THIS SUDDEN DIST ##UR ##B ##ANCE OF THE QUIET RO ##UT ##INE OF HIS LIFE
BUT I HAVE OCCASION ##ALLY DONE THE SAME THING AT OTHER TIMES
DID YOU LOOK AT THESE PAPER ##S ON THE TABLE
HOW CAME YOU TO LEAVE THE KE ##Y IN THE DOOR
ANY ##ONE IN THE ROOM COULD GET OUT YES SIR
I REALLY DON ' T THINK HE KNEW MUCH ABOUT IT MISTER HO ##L ##ME ##S
ONLY FOR A MIN ##UTE OR SO
OH I WOULD NOT VE ##N ##T ##URE TO SAY SIR
YOU HAVE ##N ' T SEEN ANY OF THEM NO SIR
IT WAS THE IND ##IAN WHOSE DARK SIL ##H ##OU ##ET ##TE APPEARED SUDDENLY UPON HIS BL ##IND
HE WAS PA ##CING SW ##IFT ##LY UP AND DOWN HIS ROOM
THIS SET OF ROOM ##S IS QUITE THE OLD ##EST IN THE COLL ##E ##GE AND IT IS NOT UN ##US ##UAL FOR VISIT ##ORS TO GO OVER THEM
NO NAME ##S PLEASE SAID HO ##L ##ME ##S AS WE KN ##OCK ##ED AT GI ##L ##CH ##RI ##ST ' S DOOR
OF COURSE HE DID NOT REAL ##IZE THAT IT WAS I WHO WAS KN ##OCK ##ING BUT NONE THE LESS HIS COND ##UCT WAS VERY UNC ##OUR ##TE ##OUS AND INDEED UNDER THE CIRCUMST ##ANCES RATHER SUS ##P ##IC ##IOUS
THAT IS VERY IMPORT ##ANT SAID HO ##L ##ME ##S
YOU DON ' T SEEM TO REAL ##IZE THE POSITION
TO MOR ##RO ##W IS THE EXAM ##INATION
I CANNOT ALL ##OW THE EXAM ##INATION TO BE HELD IF ONE OF THE PAPER ##S HAS BEEN T ##AMP ##ERED WITH THE SIT ##U ##ATION MUST BE FACE ##D
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT I MAY BE IN A POSITION THEN TO IND ##IC ##ATE SOME COURSE OF ACT ##ION
I WILL TAKE THE BLACK CL ##AY WITH ME ALSO THE PEN ##CI ##L CUT ##TING ##S GOOD BY ##E
WHEN WE WERE OUT IN THE DARK ##NESS OF THE QU ##AD ##RA ##NG ##LE WE AGAIN LOOKED UP AT THE WINDOW ##S
THE FO ##UL MOUTH ##ED FELLOW AT THE TOP
HE IS THE ONE WITH THE WOR ##ST RECO ##R ##D
WHY B ##AN ##N ##ISTER THE SERV ##ANT WHAT ' S HIS G ##AME IN THE MATTER
HE IMP ##RESSED ME AS BEING A PERFECT ##LY HON ##EST MAN
MY FRIEND DID NOT APPEAR TO BE DEP ##RESSED BY HIS FA ##IL ##URE BUT SH ##RU ##GG ##ED HIS SHOULD ##ERS IN HALF HUM ##OR ##OUS RES ##IGN ##ATION
NO GOOD MY DEAR WAT ##SON
I THINK SO YOU HAVE FORM ##ED A CON ##CL ##USION
YES MY DEAR WAT ##SON I HAVE SOL ##VED THE MY ##STER ##Y
LOOK AT THAT HE HELD OUT HIS HAND
ON THE PAL ##M WERE THREE LITTLE P ##Y ##RA ##M ##ID ##S OF BLACK DO ##UG ##H ##Y CL ##AY
AND ONE MORE THIS MORNING
IN A FEW HOURS THE EXAM ##INATION WOULD COMM ##ENCE AND HE WAS STILL IN THE D ##ILE ##M ##MA BETWEEN MAKING THE FACT ##S PUBLIC AND ALL ##OWING THE C ##UL ##PR ##IT TO COMP ##ET ##E FOR THE VAL ##U ##ABLE SCH ##OL ##ARS ##H ##IP
HE COULD HARDLY STAND STILL SO GREAT WAS HIS MEN ##T ##AL AG ##IT ##ATION AND HE RAN TOWARDS HO ##L ##ME ##S WITH TWO E ##AGER HANDS OUT ##ST ##RET ##CHED THAN ##K HEAVEN THAT YOU HAVE COME
YOU KNOW HIM I THINK SO
IF THIS MATTER IS NOT TO BECOME PUBLIC WE MUST GIVE OUR ##SELVES CERTAIN POWER ##S AND RESOL ##VE OUR ##SELVES INTO A SMALL PRIV ##ATE COURT MAR ##T ##IAL
NO SIR CERTAINLY NOT
THERE WAS NO MAN SIR
HIS TROUBLE ##D BLUE EYES GL ##ANCED AT EACH OF US AND FIN ##ALLY REST ##ED WITH AN EXPRESS ##ION OF BLA ##N ##K DIS ##MA ##Y UPON B ##AN ##N ##ISTER IN THE FAR ##THER CORN ##ER
JUST CLOSE THE DOOR SAID HO ##L ##ME ##S
WE WANT TO KNOW MISTER GI ##L ##CH ##RI ##ST HOW YOU AN HON ##OURA ##BLE MAN EVER CAME TO COMM ##IT SUCH AN ACT ##ION AS THAT OF YES ##TER ##DAY
FOR A MOMENT GI ##L ##CH ##RI ##ST WITH UP ##RA ##ISED HAND TRIED TO CONTR ##OL HIS WR ##ITH ##ING FE ##AT ##URES
COME COME SAID HO ##L ##ME ##S KIND ##LY IT IS HUMAN TO ER ##R AND AT LEAST NO ONE CAN ACC ##USE YOU OF BEING A CALL ##OUS CR ##IM ##IN ##AL
WELL WELL DON ' T TROUBLE TO ANSWER LIST ##EN AND SEE THAT I DO YOU NO IN ##J ##UST ##ICE
HE COULD EXAM ##INE THE PAPER ##S IN HIS OWN OFFIC ##E
THE IND ##IAN I ALSO THOUGHT NOTHING OF
WHEN I APPROACH ##ED YOUR ROOM I EXAM ##INED THE WINDOW
NO ONE LESS THAN THAT WOULD HAVE A CHANCE
I ENTERED AND I TOOK YOU INTO MY CONF ##IDENCE AS TO THE SUGG ##EST ##IONS OF THE SIDE TABLE
HE RETURNED CARRY ##ING HIS J ##UMP ##ING SHO ##ES WHICH ARE PROV ##IDED AS YOU ARE AW ##ARE WITH SEVERAL SHAR ##P SP ##IKE ##S
NO HAR ##M WOULD HAVE BEEN DONE HAD IT NOT BEEN THAT AS HE PASSED YOUR DOOR HE PER ##CEIVED THE KE ##Y WHICH HAD BEEN LEFT BY THE CARE ##LESS ##NESS OF YOUR SERV ##ANT
A SUDDEN IMP ##UL ##SE CAME OVER HIM TO ENTER AND SEE IF THEY WERE INDEED THE PRO ##O ##F ##S
HE PUT HIS SHO ##ES ON THE TABLE
GL ##OVE ##S SAID THE YOUNG MAN
SUDDENLY HE HEARD HIM AT THE VERY DOOR THERE WAS NO POSSIBLE ESC ##APE
HAVE I TOLD THE TRUTH MISTER GI ##L ##CH ##RI ##ST
I HAVE A LETTER HERE MISTER SO ##AMES WHICH I WR ##OTE TO YOU EARLY THIS MORNING IN THE MID ##DLE OF A REST ##LESS NIGHT
IT WILL BE CLEAR TO YOU FROM WHAT I HAVE SAID THAT ONLY YOU COULD HAVE LET THIS YOUNG MAN OUT SINCE YOU WERE LEFT IN THE ROOM AND MUST HAVE LO ##CK ##ED THE DOOR WHEN YOU WENT OUT
IT WAS SIM ##PLE ENOUGH SIR IF YOU ONLY HAD KNOWN BUT WITH ALL YOUR CLE ##VERN ##ESS IT WAS IMPOSS ##IBLE THAT YOU COULD KNOW
IF MISTER SO ##AMES SAW THEM THE G ##AME WAS UP
IN THE DE ##B ##ATE BETWEEN THE SE ##N ##IOR SOCI ##ET ##IES HER DEF ##ENCE OF THE FIF ##TEEN ##TH AM ##END ##MENT HAD BEEN NOT ONLY A NOT ##ABLE BIT OF REASON ##ING BUT DEL ##IVER ##ED WITH REAL ENT ##H ##US ##IA ##S ##M

I OFTEN HEARD HER TALK OF YOU IN THE SAME SORT OF WAY
WHEN SHE HAD THAT BAD ILL ##NESS AND I WAS ONLY ELE ##VEN YEARS OLD SHE USED TO SAY YOU ' LL HAVE A FRIEND ON EARTH IN YOUR AUNT RA ##CH ##EL IF I ' M TAKEN FROM YOU FOR SHE HAS A KIND HEART AND I ' M SURE I ' VE FOUND IT SO

I CAN NO MORE HELP SPE ##ND ##ING MY LIFE IN TRY ##ING TO DO WHAT I CAN FOR THE SOUL ##S OF OTHERS THAN YOU COULD HELP RUN ##NING IF YOU HEARD LITTLE TO ##T ##TY CRY ##ING AT THE OTHER END OF THE HOUSE THE VOICE WOULD GO TO YOUR HEART YOU WOULD THINK THE DEAR CHILD WAS IN TROUBLE OR IN DANGER AND YOU COULD ##N ' T REST WITHOUT RUN ##NING TO HELP HER AND COMFORT HER
I ' VE STRONG ASS ##UR ##ANCE THAT NO EV ##IL WILL HAPP ##EN TO YOU AND MY UNCLE AND THE CHILDREN FROM ANYTHING I ' VE DONE

FOR SOME YEARS IT WAS NOT FOUND FE ##AS ##IBLE TO OP ##ER ##ATE MOT ##ORS ON AL ##TERN ##ATING CUR ##REN ##T CIRC ##U ##ITS AND THAT REASON WAS OFTEN U ##R ##GED AGAINST IT SER ##IOUSLY
IT COULD NOT BE USED FOR ELE ##CT ##RO ##PL ##ATING OR DEP ##OSITION NOR COULD IT CHAR ##GE STO ##RA ##GE BAT ##TER ##IES ALL OF WHICH ARE EAS ##ILY WITHIN THE AB ##ILITY OF THE DIRECT CUR ##REN ##T

MISTER ED ##ISON WAS A LEAD ##ER FAR AH ##EAD OF THE TIME
HE OB ##TAINED THE DESIRE ##D SPE ##ED AND LO ##AD WITH A FR ##ICT ##ION BRA ##KE ALSO REG ##UL ##AT ##OR OF SPE ##ED BUT WAIT ##ED FOR AN IND ##IC ##AT ##OR TO VER ##IF ##Y IT
THEN AGAIN THERE WAS NO KNOWN WAY TO LU ##BR ##IC ##ATE AN ENG ##INE FOR CONTIN ##U ##OUS RUN ##NING AND MISTER ED ##ISON INFORM ##ED ME THAT AS A MAR ##INE ENG ##INE START ##ED BEFORE THE SHIP LEFT NEW Y ##OR ##K AND CONTINUED RUN ##NING UNTIL IT REACHED ITS HOME PORT SO AN ENG ##INE FOR HIS PURPOSE ##S MUST PRODU ##CE LIGHT AT ALL TIMES

IT WAS SPE ##CI ##ALLY SU ##ITED FOR A TRI ##AL PLAN ##T ALSO IN THE EARLY DAYS WHEN A Y ##IELD OF SIX OR EIGHT LA ##M ##PS TO THE HORSE POWER WAS CONSIDER ##ED SUBJECT FOR CON ##GR ##AT ##UL ##ATION

THE LORD WHO HAS GIVEN US POWER TO TE ##ACH AND TO HEAR LET HIM ALSO GIVE US THE POWER TO SERV ##E AND TO DO LU ##KE TWO
THE WORD OF OUR GOD SHALL STAND FORE ##VER
IN EVERY WAY THEY SOU ##GHT TO UNDER ##M ##INE THE AUTHOR ##ITY OF SAINT PA ##UL
THEY SAID TO THE G ##AL ##AT ##IANS YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO THINK HIGH ##LY OF PA ##UL
HE WAS THE LAST TO TURN TO CHRIST
PA ##UL CAME LATER AND IS BENE ##ATH US
INDEED HE PERS ##E ##C ##UTE ##D THE CHURCH OF CHRIST FOR A LONG TIME
DO YOU SUPPOSE THAT GOD FOR THE SA ##KE OF A FEW LU ##THER ##AN HERE ##T ##ICS WOULD DIS ##OWN HIS ENTIRE CHURCH
AGAINST THESE BO ##AST ##ING FA ##LS ##E AP ##OST ##LES PA ##UL BO ##LD ##LY DEF ##END ##S HIS AP ##OST ##OL ##IC AUTHOR ##ITY AND MIN ##IST ##RY
AS THE AM ##B ##ASS ##AD ##OR OF A GOVERN ##MENT IS HON ##ORED FOR HIS OFFIC ##E AND NOT FOR HIS PRIV ##ATE PERSON SO THE MIN ##ISTER OF CHRIST SHOULD EX ##AL ##T HIS OFFIC ##E IN ORDER TO G ##AIN AUTHOR ##ITY AMONG MEN
PA ##UL TAKE ##S PR ##IDE IN HIS MIN ##IST ##RY NOT TO HIS OWN PR ##A ##ISE BUT TO THE PR ##A ##ISE OF GOD
PA ##UL AN AP ##OST ##LE NOT OF MEN E ##T CE ##TER ##A
EITHER HE CALL ##S MIN ##ISTER ##S THROUGH THE AGE ##N ##CY OF MEN OR HE CALL ##S THEM DIRECT ##LY AS HE CALLED THE PROP ##H ##ETS AND AP ##OST ##LES
PA ##UL DECL ##ARE ##S THAT THE FA ##LS ##E AP ##OST ##LES WERE CALLED OR SENT NEITHER BY MEN NOR BY MAN
THE MOST THEY COULD CL ##A ##IM IS THAT THEY WERE SENT BY OTHERS
HE MEN ##T ##IONS THE AP ##OST ##LES FIRST BECAUSE THEY WERE APP ##OINT ##ED DIRECT ##LY BY GOD
THE CALL IS NOT TO BE TAKEN LIGHT ##LY
FOR A PERSON TO POSS ##ESS KNOWLEDGE IS NOT ENOUGH
IT SP ##O ##ILS ONE ' S BEST WORK
WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN I THOUGHT PA ##UL WAS MAKING TOO MUCH OF HIS CALL
I DID NOT THEN REAL ##IZE THE IMPORT ##ANCE OF THE MIN ##IST ##RY
I KNEW NOTHING OF THE DOCT ##RI ##NE OF FAITH BECAUSE WE WERE T ##AUGHT SO ##PH ##IST ##RY INSTEAD OF CERTAIN ##TY AND NO ##BODY UNDERST ##OOD SPIRIT ##UAL BO ##AST ##ING
THIS IS NO S ##IN ##FUL PR ##IDE IT IS HO ##LY PR ##IDE
AND GOD THE FATHER WHO RA ##ISED HIM FROM THE DEAD
THE CL ##AUSE SEEMS SUPER ##F ##L ##U ##OUS ON FIRST SIGHT
THESE PER ##VER ##TERS OF THE RIGHT ##E ##OUS ##NESS OF CHRIST RES ##IST THE FATHER AND THE SON AND THE WORK ##S OF THEM BOTH
IN THIS WHOLE E ##P ##IST ##LE PA ##UL TREAT ##S OF THE RES ##UR ##RE ##CTION OF CHRIST
BY HIS RES ##UR ##RE ##CTION CHRIST WON THE VICT ##ORY OVER LAW S ##IN FLE ##SH WORLD DEV ##IL DEATH HEL ##L AND EVERY EV ##IL
VER ##SE TWO
AND ALL THE BRE ##TH ##REN WHICH ARE WITH ME
THIS SHOULD GO FAR IN SH ##UT ##TING THE MOUTH ##S OF THE FA ##LS ##E AP ##OST ##LES
ALTHOUGH THE BRE ##TH ##REN WITH ME ARE NOT AP ##OST ##LES LIKE MYSELF YET THEY ARE ALL OF ONE MIND WITH ME THINK WR ##ITE AND TE ##ACH AS I DO
THEY DO NOT GO WHERE THE ENEM ##IES OF THE GO ##S ##PE ##L PRE ##D ##OM ##IN ##ATE THEY GO WHERE THE CHRIST ##IANS ARE
WHY DO THEY NOT INV ##ADE THE CAT ##H ##OL ##IC PROV ##INCE ##S AND PRE ##ACH THEIR DOCT ##RI ##NE TO GOD ##LESS PRINCE ##S B ##ISH ##OP ##S AND DOCTOR ##S AS WE HAVE DONE BY THE HELP OF GOD
WE LOOK FOR THAT RE ##WARD WHICH EYE HAT ##H NOT SEEN NOR EAR HEARD NEITHER HAT ##H ENTERED INTO THE HEART OF MAN
NOT ALL THE G ##AL ##AT ##IANS HAD BECOME PER ##VER ##TED
THESE MEANS CANNOT BE CONT ##AM ##IN ##ATED
THEY REM ##AIN DIV ##INE REGARD ##LESS OF MEN ' S OPIN ##ION
WHERE ##VER THE MEANS OF GRACE ARE FOUND THERE IS THE HO ##LY CHURCH EVEN THOUGH AN ##T ##ICH ##RI ##ST RE ##IGN ##S THERE
SO MUCH FOR THE T ##IT ##LE OF THE E ##P ##IST ##LE NOW FOLLOW ##S THE GRE ##ET ##ING OF THE AP ##OST ##LE VER ##SE THREE
GRACE BE TO YOU AND PEACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND FROM OUR LORD JE ##S ##US CHRIST
THE TER ##MS OF GRACE AND PEACE ARE COMMON TER ##MS WITH PA ##UL AND ARE NOW PRETTY WELL UNDERST ##OOD
THE GRE ##ET ##ING OF THE AP ##OST ##LE IS REF ##RES ##HING
GRACE INV ##OL ##VES THE REM ##ISS ##ION OF S ##INS PEACE AND A HAPPY CONS ##CI ##ENCE
THE WORLD BRA ##ND ##S THIS A PER ##N ##IC ##IOUS DOCT ##RI ##NE
EXPER ##IENCE PROV ##ES THIS
HOWEVER THE GRACE AND PEACE OF GOD WILL
MEN SHOULD NOT SPE ##CUL ##ATE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
WAS IT NOT ENOUGH TO SAY FROM GOD THE FATHER
TO DO SO IS TO LO ##SE GOD AL ##TO ##GETHER BECAUSE GOD BECOME ##S INTO ##LER ##ABLE WHEN WE SEE ##K TO ME ##AS ##URE AND TO COMP ##RE ##H ##END HIS INF ##IN ##ITE MAJ ##EST ##Y
HE CAME DOWN TO EARTH LIVED AMONG MEN SUFF ##ERED WAS CR ##U ##CI ##F ##IED AND THEN HE DIED STANDING CLEAR ##LY BEFORE US SO THAT OUR HEART ##S AND EYES MAY FAST ##EN UPON HIM
EMB ##RA ##CE HIM AND FORG ##ET ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD
DID NOT CHRIST HIMSELF SAY I AM THE WAY AND THE TRUTH AND THE LIFE NO MAN COME ##TH UNT ##O THE FATHER BUT BY ME
WHEN YOU AR ##G ##UE ABOUT THE NATURE OF GOD AP ##ART FROM THE QUESTION OF JUST ##IFIC ##ATION YOU MAY BE AS PROF ##OUND AS YOU LIKE
WE ARE TO HEAR CHRIST WHO HAS BEEN APP ##OINT ##ED BY THE FATHER AS OUR DIV ##INE TE ##ACH ##ER
AT THE SAME TIME PA ##UL CONF ##IR ##MS OUR CRE ##ED THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD
THAT CHRIST IS VERY GOD IS APP ##ARE ##N ##T IN THAT PA ##UL AS ##CRIB ##ES TO HIM DIV ##INE POWER ##S EQU ##ALLY WITH THE FATHER AS FOR INST ##ANCE THE POWER TO DISP ##ENSE GRACE AND PEACE
TO BEST ##OW PEACE AND GRACE LIE ##S IN THE PROV ##INCE OF GOD WHO ALONE CAN CREAT ##E THESE BL ##ESS ##INGS THE ANG ##ELS CANNOT
OTHER ##W ##ISE PA ##UL SHOULD HAVE WR ##ITT ##EN GRACE FROM GOD THE FATHER AND PEACE FROM OUR LORD JE ##S ##US CHRIST
THE AR ##IANS TOOK CHRIST FOR A NO ##BLE AND PERFECT CREAT ##URE SUPER ##IOR EVEN TO THE ANG ##ELS BECAUSE BY HIM GOD CREAT ##ED HEAVEN AND EARTH
MO ##H ##AM ##MED ALSO SPEAK ##S HIGH ##LY OF CHRIST
PA ##UL ST ##ICK ##S TO HIS THEM ##E
HE NEVER LO ##SE ##S SIGHT OF THE PURPOSE OF HIS E ##P ##IST ##LE
NOT GOLD OR SIL ##VER OR PA ##S ##CH ##AL LA ##MB ##S OR AN ANG ##EL BUT HIMSELF WHAT FOR
NOT FOR A CROW ##N OR A KING ##D ##OM OR OUR GOOD ##NESS BUT FOR OUR S ##INS
UNDER ##S ##CO ##RE THESE WORDS FOR THEY ARE FULL OF COMFORT FOR SO ##RE CONS ##CI ##ENCES
HOW MAY WE OB ##TAIN REM ##ISS ##ION OF OUR S ##INS
PA ##UL ANSWER ##S THE MAN WHO IS NAME ##D JE ##S ##US CHRIST AND THE SON OF GOD GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR S ##INS
SINCE CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR S ##INS IT STAND ##S TO REASON THAT THEY CANNOT BE PUT AWAY BY OUR OWN EFF ##ORT ##S
THIS SENT ##ENCE ALSO DEF ##INES OUR S ##INS AS GREAT SO GREAT IN FACT THAT THE WHOLE WORLD COULD NOT MAKE AM ##END ##S FOR A SING ##LE S ##IN
THE GREAT ##NESS OF THE RAN ##SO ##M CHRIST THE SON OF GOD IND ##IC ##ATES THIS
THE VI ##CIOUS CHARACTER OF S ##IN IS BROUGHT OUT BY THE WORDS WHO GAVE HIMSELF FOR OUR S ##INS
BUT WE ARE CARE ##LESS WE MAKE LIGHT OF S ##IN
WE THINK THAT BY SOME LITTLE WORK OR MER ##IT WE CAN DIS ##M ##ISS S ##IN
THIS PASS ##AGE THEN BEAR ##S OUT THE FACT THAT ALL MEN ARE SOLD UNDER S ##IN
THIS ATT ##ITUDE SPR ##INGS FROM A FA ##LS ##E CON ##CEPT ##ION OF S ##IN THE CON ##CEPT ##ION THAT S ##IN IS A SMALL MATTER EAS ##ILY TAKEN CARE OF BY GOOD WORK ##S THAT WE MUST PRESENT OUR ##SELVES UNT ##O GOD WITH A GOOD CONS ##CI ##ENCE THAT WE MUST FEEL NO S ##IN BEFORE WE MAY FEEL THAT CHRIST WAS GIVEN FOR OUR S ##INS
THIS ATT ##ITUDE IS UN ##IVER ##S ##AL AND PARTICULAR ##LY DEV ##EL ##OP ##ED IN THOSE WHO CONSIDER THEMSELVES BETTER THAN OTHERS
BUT THE REAL SIGN ##IFIC ##ANCE AND COMFORT OF THE WORDS FOR OUR S ##INS IS LOST UPON THEM
ON THE OTHER HAND WE ARE NOT TO REGARD THEM AS SO TERRI ##BLE THAT WE MUST DESP ##AIR

WE DO NOT KNOW HOW PLA ##TO WOULD HAVE ARR ##ANGED HIS OWN D ##IAL ##OG ##UES OR WHETHER THE THOUGHT OF ARR ##ANG ##ING ANY OF THEM BESIDES THE TWO TRI ##L ##OG ##IES WHICH HE HAS EXPRESS ##LY CON ##NE ##CTED WAS EVER PRESENT TO HIS MIND
THE D ##IAL ##OG ##UE IS PR ##IM ##AR ##ILY CONCER ##NED WITH THE ANIM ##AL CREAT ##ION INCL ##UD ##ING UNDER THIS TER ##M THE HEAVEN ##LY BO ##D ##IES AND WITH MAN ONLY AS ONE AMONG THE ANIM ##ALS

THE ST ##Y ##LE AND PLAN OF THE TIM ##A ##E ##US DIFFER GREAT ##LY FROM THAT OF ANY OTHER OF THE PLA ##TON ##IC D ##IAL ##OG ##UES

NOTHING CAN EXC ##EE ##D THE BEAUTY OR ART OF THE INT ##RO ##DU ##CTION IN WHICH HE IS US ##ING WORDS AFTER HIS ACC ##USTOM ##ED MANNER

THE REST OF YOU OFF A VI ##KING HE HAD THREE SHIP ##S
THESE HE GAVE TO THREE OF MY BROTHER ##S
BUT I STAY ##ED THAT SPR ##ING AND BU ##ILT ME A BOAT
I MADE HER FOR ONLY TWENTY O ##ARS BECAUSE I THOUGHT FEW MEN WOULD FOLLOW ME FOR I WAS YOUNG FIF ##TEEN YEARS OLD
AT THE PRO ##W I CAR ##VED THE HEAD WITH OPEN MOUTH AND FOR ##KED TO ##NG ##UE THR ##UST OUT

HE IS BUT A BOY THE MEN SAID
THIRTY MEN ONE AFTER ANOTHER RA ##ISED THEIR HOR ##N ##S AND SAID
AS OUR BOAT FL ##ASH ##ED DOWN THE RO ##LL ##ERS INTO THE WATER I MADE THIS SON ##G AND SA ##NG IT
SO WE HAR ##RIED THE CO ##AST OF NOR ##WAY
WE AT ##E AT MANY MEN ' S TABLE ##S UN ##IN ##V ##ITED
MY DRA ##G ##ON ' S BELL ##Y IS NEVER FULL AND ON BO ##ARD WENT THE GOLD
OH IT IS BETTER TO LIVE ON THE SEA AND LET OTHER MEN RA ##ISE YOUR CR ##OP ##S AND CO ##OK YOUR ME ##ALS
A HOUSE SM ##ELL ##S OF SM ##OKE A SHIP SM ##ELL ##S OF FR ##OL ##IC
UP AND DOWN THE WATER WE WENT TO GET MUCH WE ##ALTH AND MUCH FR ##OL ##IC
WHAT OF THE FAR ##M O ##LA ##F NOT YET I ANSWERED VI ##KING IS BETTER FOR SUM ##MER
IT WAS SO DARK THAT I COULD SEE NOTHING BUT A FEW SP ##ARK ##S ON THE HEART ##H
I STOOD WITH MY BACK TO THE WALL FOR I WANTED NO SW ##ORD REACH ##ING OUT OF THE DARK FOR ME
COME COME I CALLED WHEN NO ONE OB ##EY ##ED A FIRE

YOU WOULD NOT EAT WITH US YOU CANNOT SAY NO TO HALF OF MY AL ##E I DRINK THIS TO YOUR HEA ##LT ##H
THEN I DRA ##N ##K HALF OF THE HOR ##N ##FUL AND SENT THE REST ACROSS THE FIRE TO THE FAR ##MER HE TOOK IT AND SMILE ##D SAYING

HE SHALL NOT LEAVE YOU DAY OR NIGHT WHETHER YOU ARE WORK ##ING OR PLAY ##ING OR SLEEP ##ING

THEIR EYES DA ##N ##CED BIG TH ##OR ##LE ##IF STOOD UP AND STRE ##T ##CHED HIMSELF

THAT TIME IT POINT ##ED US INTO YOUR FATHER ' S SHIP ##S

IN FIVE MINUTES I WAS IN A NEW WORLD AND MY ME ##LA ##N ##CH ##OL ##Y ROOM WAS FULL OF THE LIVE ##L ##IEST FRENCH COMPANY
THE SOUND OF AN IMP ##ER ##ATIVE AND UNC ##OM ##PR ##OM ##ISING BELL REC ##ALL ##ED ME IN DU ##E TIME TO THE REG ##IONS OF REAL ##ITY
AM ##BR ##OSE MET ME AT THE BO ##T ##TO ##M OF THE ST ##AIRS AND SHOW ##ED ME THE WAY TO THE SUPP ##ER ROOM
SHE SIGN ##ED TO ME WITH A G ##H ##OST ##LY SOL ##EM ##N ##ITY TO TAKE THE V ##AC ##ANT PLACE ON THE LEFT OF HER FATHER
THE DOOR OPENED AGAIN WHILE I WAS STILL STUD ##YING THE TWO BROTHER ##S WITHOUT I HON ##EST ##LY CONF ##ESS BEING VERY FAV ##OR ##ABLY IMP ##RESSED BY EITHER OF THEM
A NEW MEM ##BER OF THE FAMILY CIRC ##LE WHO INST ##ANTLY ATT ##RA ##CTED MY ATTENTION ENTERED THE ROOM

OUR FIRST IMP ##RESS ##IONS OF PEOPLE ARE IN N ##INE CASE ##S OUT OF TEN THE RIGHT IMP ##RESS ##IONS
FOR ONCE IN A WAY I PROV ##ED A TRUE PROP ##H ##ET
THE ONLY CHE ##ER ##FUL CONVERS ##ATION WAS THE CONVERS ##ATION ACROSS THE TABLE BETWEEN N ##A ##OM ##I AND ME
HE LOOKED UP AT N ##A ##OM ##I DOUBT ##INGLY FROM HIS PLA ##TE AND LOOKED DOWN AGAIN SLOWLY WITH A FR ##OWN
WHEN I ADD ##RESSED HIM HE ANSWERED CONST ##RA ##INED ##LY

IT IS MAN ##IFE ##ST THAT MAN IS NOW SUBJECT TO MUCH VAR ##IA ##B ##ILITY

THE VAR ##IA ##B ##ILITY OF MU ##LT ##IP ##LE PART ##S

WHO TOU ##CHES ME AM I IN BED
MOTHER DEAR FATHER DO YOU HEAR ME
IT IS THE ONLY AM ##END ##S I ASK OF YOU FOR THE WRONG YOU HAVE DONE ME
SHE FOUND THE DOOR BUT IT WAS LO ##CK ##ED OUT ##SIDE
SHE SUCC ##EE ##DE ##D IN OPEN ##ING THE WINDOW AND THE MOON ##L ##IGHT SHO ##NE IN SO BRIGHT ##LY THAT SHE COULD DIST ##ING ##U ##ISH THE COL ##OUR OF SOME DA ##MA ##S ##K HA ##NG ##INGS IN THE ROOM
SHE SAW THAT THE BED WAS GI ##LD ##ED AND SO RICH THAT IT SEEMED THAT OF A PRINCE RATHER THAN OF A PRIV ##ATE GENTLEMAN
AMONG OTHER THINGS ON WHICH SHE CAST HER EYES WAS A SMALL CR ##U ##CI ##F ##IX OF SOL ##ID SIL ##VER STANDING ON A CA ##B ##INE ##T NEAR THE WINDOW
THIS PERSON WAS RO ##D ##OL ##F ##O WHO THOUGH HE HAD GONE TO LOOK FOR HIS FRIENDS HAD CHANGE ##D HIS MIND IN THAT RESPECT NOT THINKING IT ADV ##IS ##ABLE TO ACQU ##AINT THEM WITH WHAT HAD PASSED BETWEEN HIM AND THE GIRL
ON THE CONTR ##ARY HE RESOL ##VED TO TELL THEM THAT REPE ##N ##TING OF HIS VI ##OL ##ENCE AND MOVE ##D BY HER TEARS HE HAD ONLY CARRIED HER HALF WAY TOWARDS HIS HOUSE AND THEN LET HER GO
CH ##OK ##ING WITH EM ##OT ##ION LE ##OC ##AD ##I MADE A SIGN TO HER PAR ##ENTS THAT SHE WISH ##ED TO BE ALONE WITH THEM
THAT WOULD BE VERY WELL MY CHILD REPLIED HER FATHER IF YOUR PLAN WERE NOT LI ##ABLE TO BE FR ##UST ##RA ##TED BY ORD ##INARY C ##UN ##NING BUT NO DOUBT THIS IMAG ##E HAS BEEN ALREADY MISS ##ED BY ITS OWN ##ER AND HE WILL HAVE SET IT DOWN FOR CERTAIN THAT IT WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE ROOM BY THE PERSON HE LO ##CK ##ED UP THERE
WHAT YOU HAD BEST DO MY CHILD IS TO KEEP IT AND PRAY TO IT THAT SINCE IT WAS A W ##IT ##NESS TO YOUR UN ##D ##O ##ING IT WILL DE ##IGN TO VI ##ND ##IC ##ATE YOUR CAUSE BY ITS RIGHT ##E ##OUS JUD ##G ##MENT
THUS DID THIS HUMAN ##E AND RIGHT MIND ##ED FATHER COMFORT HIS UN ##H ##APP ##Y DAUGHTER AND HER MOTHER EMB ##RA ##CING HER AGAIN DID ALL SHE COULD TO SO ##OTH ##E HER FEELING ##S
SHE MEAN ##WH ##ILE PASSED HER LIFE WITH HER PAR ##ENTS IN THE STRI ##CT ##EST RET ##IRE ##MENT NEVER LET ##TING HERSELF BE SEEN BUT SH ##UN ##NING EVERY EYE LE ##ST IT SHOULD READ HER MIS ##FORT ##UNE IN HER FACE
TIME RO ##LLED ON THE HOUR OF HER DEL ##IVER ##Y ARRI ##VED IT TOOK PLACE IN THE UT ##MOST SEC ##RE ##CY HER MOTHER TAKING UPON HER THE OFFIC ##E OF MID ##W ##IFE AND SHE GAVE B ##IRT ##H TO A SON ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL EVER SEEN
WHEN THE BOY WALKED THROUGH THE STREET ##S BL ##ESS ##INGS WERE SHOW ##ERED UPON HIM BY ALL WHO SAW HIM BL ##ESS ##INGS UPON HIS BEAUTY UPON THE MOTHER THAT BO ##RE HIM UPON THE FATHER THAT BEG ##OT HIM UPON THOSE WHO BROUGHT HIM UP SO WELL
ONE DAY WHEN THE BOY WAS SENT BY HIS GRAND ##F ##ATHER WITH A ME ##S ##S ##AGE TO A REL ##ATION HE PASSED ALONG A STREET IN WHICH THERE WAS A GREAT CON ##CO ##UR ##SE OF HORSE ##MEN
THE BED SHE TOO WELL REMEMBER ##ED WAS THERE AND ABOVE ALL THE CA ##B ##INE ##T ON WHICH HAD STOOD THE IMAG ##E SHE HAD TAKEN AWAY WAS STILL ON THE SAME SP ##OT
LU ##IS WAS OUT OF DANGER IN A FORT ##N ##IGHT IN A MONTH HE ROSE FROM HIS BED AND DURING ALL THAT TIME HE WAS VISIT ##ED DA ##ILY BY HIS MOTHER AND GRAND ##M ##OTHER AND TREAT ##ED BY THE MASTER AND MIST ##RESS OF THE HOUSE AS IF HE WAS THEIR OWN CHILD
THUS SAYING AND PRES ##S ##ING THE CR ##U ##CI ##F ##IX TO HER BRE ##AST SHE FELL FA ##INT ##ING INTO THE ARMS OF DON ##A EST ##A ##F ##AN ##IA WHO AS A GENTLE ##W ##OM ##AN TO WHOSE SE ##X P ##ITY IS AS NATURAL AS CR ##UE ##LT ##Y IS TO MAN INST ##ANTLY PRES ##SE ##D HER LIPS TO THOSE OF THE FA ##INT ##ING GIRL SHE ##D ##D ##ING OVER HER SO MANY TEARS THAT THERE NEED ##ED NO OTHER SPR ##INK ##LING OF WATER TO RECO ##VER LE ##OC ##AD ##IA FROM HER SW ##OON
I HAVE GREAT THINGS TO TELL YOU SE ##N ##OR SAID DON ##A EST ##A ##F ##AN ##IA TO HER HUSBAND THE CRE ##AM AND SUB ##ST ##ANCE OF WHICH IS THIS THE FA ##INT ##ING GIRL BEFORE YOU IS YOUR DAUGHTER AND THAT BOY IS YOUR GRAND ##SON
THIS TRUTH WHICH I HAVE LEAR ##NED FROM HER LIPS IS CONF ##IR ##MED BY HIS FACE IN WHICH WE HAVE BOTH BEH ##EL ##D THAT OF OUR SON
JUST THEN LE ##OC ##AD ##IA CAME TO HERSELF AND EMB ##RA ##CING THE CROSS SEEMED CHANGE ##D INTO A SEA OF TEARS AND THE GENTLEMAN REM ##AINED IN UT ##TER BE ##W ##ILD ##ER ##MENT UNTIL HIS WIFE HAD REPE ##ATED TO HIM FROM BEGIN ##NING TO END LE ##OC ##AD ##IA ' S WHOLE STORY AND HE BELIEVE ##D IT THROUGH THE BL ##ESSED DISP ##ENS ##ATION OF HEAVEN WHICH HAD CONF ##IR ##MED IT BY SO MANY CONV ##IN ##CING TE ##ST ##IM ##ON ##IES
SO PERS ##U ##AS ##IVE WERE HER ENT ##REAT ##IES AND SO STRONG HER ASS ##UR ##ANCES THAT NO HAR ##M WHATEVER COULD RES ##ULT TO THEM FROM THE INFORM ##ATION SHE SOU ##GHT THEY WERE IND ##U ##CED TO CONF ##ESS THAT ONE SUM ##MER ' S NIGHT THE SAME SHE HAD MEN ##T ##ION ##ED THEMSELVES AND ANOTHER FRIEND BEING OUT ON A STR ##OL ##L WITH RO ##D ##OL ##F ##O THEY HAD BEEN CONCER ##NED IN THE AB ##DU ##CTION OF A GIRL WHOM RO ##D ##OL ##F ##O CARRIED OFF WH ##ILS ##T THE REST OF THEM DET ##AINED HER FAMILY WHO MADE A GREAT OUT ##C ##RY AND WOULD HAVE DEF ##END ##ED HER IF THEY COULD
FOR GOD ' S SA ##KE MY LADY MOTHER GIVE ME A WIFE WHO WOULD BE AN AG ##REE ##ABLE COMPAN ##ION NOT ONE WHO WILL DIS ##G ##UST ME SO THAT WE MAY BOTH BEAR EVEN ##LY AND WITH MU ##T ##UAL GOOD WILL THE Y ##OKE IMP ##OSED ON US BY HEAVEN INSTEAD OF PULL ##ING THIS WAY AND THAT WAY AND FRE ##T ##TING EACH OTHER TO DEATH
HER BEAR ##ING WAS GRACE ##FUL AND ANIM ##ATED SHE LED HER SON BY THE HAND AND BEFORE HER WALKED TWO MAID ##S WITH WA ##X LIGHT ##S AND SIL ##VER CAN ##DLE ##ST ##ICK ##S
ALL ROSE TO DO HER REV ##ERE ##N ##CE AS IF SOMETHING FROM HEAVEN HAD M ##IR ##AC ##UL ##OUSLY APPEARED BEFORE THEM BUT G ##AZ ##ING ON HER ENT ##RA ##N ##CED WITH ADM ##IR ##ATION NOT ONE OF THEM WAS ABLE TO ADD ##RESS A SING ##LE WORD TO HER
SHE REF ##LE ##CTED HOW NEAR SHE STOOD TO THE CR ##IS ##IS WHICH WAS TO DETERM ##INE WHETHER SHE WAS TO BE BL ##ESSED OR UN ##H ##APP ##Y FOR EVER AND RA ##CK ##ED BY THE INT ##ENS ##ITY OF HER EM ##OT ##IONS SHE SUDDENLY CHANGE ##D COL ##OUR HER HEAD DRO ##PPED AND SHE FELL FORWARD IN A SW ##OON INTO THE ARMS OF THE DIS ##MA ##Y ##ED EST ##A ##F ##AN ##IA
HIS MOTHER HAD LEFT HER TO HIM AS BEING HER DEST ##INED PROT ##ECT ##OR BUT WHEN SHE SAW THAT HE TOO WAS INS ##ENS ##IBLE SHE WAS NEAR MAKING A THIRD AND WOULD HAVE DONE SO HAD HE NOT COME TO HIMSELF
KNOW THEN SON OF MY HEART THAT THIS FA ##INT ##ING LADY IS YOUR REAL BR ##IDE I SAY REAL BECAUSE SHE IS THE ONE WHOM YOUR FATHER AND I HAVE CH ##OSE ##N FOR YOU AND THE PORT ##RA ##IT WAS A PRET ##ENCE
JUST AT THE MOMENT WHEN THE TEARS OF THE P ##ITY ##ING BEH ##OLD ##ERS FLO ##W ##ED FAST ##EST AND THEIR E ##J ##AC ##UL ##ATIONS WERE MOST EXPRESS ##IVE OF DESP ##AIR LE ##OC ##AD ##IA GAVE SIGN ##S OF RECO ##VER ##Y AND BROUGHT BACK GLAD ##NESS TO THE HEART ##S OF ALL
WHEN SHE CAME TO HER SENSE ##S AND BL ##USH ##ING TO FIND HERSELF IN RO ##D ##OL ##F ##O ' S ARMS WOULD HAVE DIS ##ENG ##AGED HERSELF NO SE ##N ##OR ##A HE SAID THAT MUST NOT BE STRI ##VE NOT TO WITH ##D ##RA ##W FROM THE ARMS OF HIM WHO HOLD ##S YOU IN HIS SOUL
THIS WAS DONE FOR THE EVEN ##T TOOK PLACE AT A TIME WHEN THE CONSE ##N ##T OF THE PART ##IES WAS SUFF ##IC ##IENT FOR THE CE ##LE ##BR ##ATION OF A MAR ##RIAGE WITHOUT ANY OF THE PRE ##L ##IM ##INARY FORM ##AL ##ITIES WHICH ARE NOW SO PROPER ##LY REQU ##IRED
NOR WAS RO ##D ##OL ##F ##O LESS SURPR ##ISED THAN THEY AND THE BETTER TO ASS ##URE HIMSELF OF SO WONDER ##FUL A FACT HE BEG ##GED LE ##OC ##AD ##IA TO GIVE HIM SOME TO ##KE ##N WHICH SHOULD MAKE PERFECT ##LY CLEAR TO HIM THAT WHICH INDEED HE DID NOT DOUBT SINCE IT WAS AUTH ##ENT ##IC ##ATED BY HIS PAR ##ENTS
YOU KNOW CAPTAIN LA ##KE
SAID LORD CHE ##LF ##ORD ADD ##RESS ##ING ME
HE HAD HIS HAND UPON LA ##KE ' S SHOULD ##ER
THEY ARE CO ##US ##INS YOU KNOW WE ARE ALL CO ##US ##INS
WHATEVER LORD CHE ##LF ##ORD SAID MISS BRA ##NDON RECEIVED IT VERY GRA ##CIOUS ##LY AND EVEN WITH A MOMENT ##ARY SMILE
BUT HER GRE ##ET ##ING TO CAPTAIN LA ##KE WAS MORE THAN US ##UALLY HA ##UGHT ##Y AND FR ##O ##Z ##EN AND HER FE ##AT ##URES I FAN ##CI ##ED PARTICULAR ##LY PRO ##UD AND PAL ##E
AT DINNER LA ##KE WAS EAS ##Y AND AM ##US ##ING
I ' M GLAD YOU LIKE IT SAYS W ##Y ##LD ##ER CH ##UCK ##LING BE ##N ##IGN ##ANTLY ON IT OVER HIS SHOULD ##ER
I BELIEVE I HAVE A LITTLE T ##AST ##E THAT WAY THOSE ARE ALL REAL YOU KNOW THOSE JE ##W ##ELS
AND HE PLACED IT IN THAT GENTLEMAN ' S FING ##ERS WHO NOW TOOK HIS TURN AT THE LA ##M ##P AND CONT ##EM ##PL ##ATED THE LITTLE PAR ##ALL ##EL ##OG ##RA ##M WITH A GL ##E ##AM OF SL ##Y AM ##USE ##MENT
I WAS THINKING IT ' S VERY LIKE THE AC ##E OF HEART ##S ANSWERED THE CAPTAIN SOFT ##LY SM ##ILING ON
WHERE ##UP ##ON LA ##KE LAUGH ##ED QUIET ##LY STILL LOOKING ON THE AC ##E OF HEART ##S WITH HIS SL ##Y EYES
AND W ##Y ##LD ##ER LAUGH ##ED TOO MORE SUDDENLY AND NO ##IS ##ILY THAN THE HUM ##OUR OF THE JO ##KE SEEMED QUITE TO CALL FOR AND GL ##ANCED A GR ##IM LOOK FROM THE CORN ##ERS OF HIS EYES ON LA ##KE BUT THE G ##ALL ##ANT CAPTAIN DID NOT SEEM TO PER ##CEIVE IT AND AFTER A FEW SECOND ##S MORE HE HAND ##ED IT VERY INN ##OC ##ENTLY BACK TO MISSUS DO ##RO ##TH ##Y ONLY REMARK ##ING
DO YOU KNOW LA ##KE OH I REALLY CAN ' T TELL BUT HE ' LL SOON T ##IRE OF COUNTRY LIFE
HE ' S NOT A MAN FOR COUNTRY QUAR ##TERS
I HAD A HOR ##RI ##D DREAM ABOUT HIM LAST NIGHT THAT
OH I KNOW THAT ' S LO ##R ##NE BRA ##NDON
ALL THE TIME HE WAS TALK ##ING TO ME HIS ANG ##RY LITTLE EYES WERE FOLLOW ##ING LA ##KE
MISS LA ##KE DECL ##INED THE CAR ##RIAGE TO NIGHT
AND HE ADDED SOMETHING STILL LESS COMP ##L ##IMENT ##ARY
BUT DON ' T THESE VERY W ##ISE THINGS SOMETIMES TURN OUT VERY FOOL ##ISH ##LY
IN THE MEANT ##IME I HAD FORM ##ED A NEW IDEA OF HER
BY THIS TIME LORD CHE ##LF ##ORD AND W ##Y ##LD ##ER RETURNED AND DIS ##G ##UST ##ED RATHER WITH MYSELF I RU ##M ##IN ##ATED ON MY WANT OF GENERAL SHIP
AND HE MADE A LITTLE D ##IP OF HIS CAN ##E TOWARDS BRA ##NDON HALL OVER HIS SHOULD ##ER
YES SO THEY SAID BUT THAT WOULD I THINK HAVE BEEN WOR ##SE
IF A FELLOW ' S BEEN A LITTLE BIT WILD HE ' S BE ##EL ##Z ##E ##B ##UB AT ONCE
BRA ##CT ##ON ' S A VERY GOOD FELLOW I CAN ASS ##URE YOU
I DON ' T KNOW AND CAN ' T SAY HOW YOU FINE GENTLE ##MEN DEF ##INE W ##ICKED ##NESS ONLY AS AN OBS ##C ##URE FE ##MA ##LE I SPEAK ACCORD ##ING TO MY LIGHT ##S AND HE IS GENERAL ##LY THOUGHT THE W ##ICKED ##EST MAN IN THIS COUNT ##Y
WELL YOU KNOW RA ##D ##IE WOMEN LIKE W ##ICKED FELLOW ##S IT IS CONTR ##AST I SUPPOSE BUT THEY DO AND I ' M SURE FROM WHAT BRA ##CT ##ON HAS SAID TO ME I KNOW HIM INT ##IM ##ATELY THAT DO ##R ##C ##AS LIKE ##S HIM AND I CAN ' T CON ##CEIVE WHY THEY ARE NOT MAR ##RIED
THEIR WALK CONTINUED SIL ##ENT FOR THE GREAT ##ER PART NEITHER WAS QUITE SATISF ##IED WITH THE OTHER BUT RA ##CH ##EL AT LAST SAID
NOW THAT ' S IMPOSS ##IBLE RA ##D ##IE FOR I REALLY DON ' T THINK I ONCE THOUGHT OF HIM ALL THIS EVENING EXCEPT JUST WHILE WE WERE TALK ##ING
THERE WAS A BRIGHT MOON ##L ##IGHT BR ##OKEN BY THE SHAD ##OWS OF OVER ##H ##ANG ##ING BO ##UG ##H ##S AND WITH ##ERED LEAVE ##S AND THE MOT ##TLE ##D LIGHT ##S AND SHAD ##OWS GL ##IDED O ##D ##D ##LY ACROSS HIS PAL ##E FE ##AT ##URES
DON ' T INS ##ULT ME ST ##AN ##LEY BY TALK ##ING AGAIN AS YOU DID THIS MORNING
WHAT I SAY IS AL ##TO ##GETHER ON YOUR OWN ACCOUNT
MAR ##K MY WORDS YOU ' LL FIND HIM TOO STRONG FOR YOU A ##Y ##E AND TOO DEEP
I AM VERY UN ##E ##AS ##Y ABOUT IT WHATEVER IT IS I CAN ' T HELP IT
TO MY MIND THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SOMETHING IN ##E ##X ##PR ##ESS ##IB ##LY AW ##FUL IN FAMILY FE ##UD ##S
THE MY ##STER ##Y OF THEIR OR ##IG ##IN THEIR CAP ##AC ##ITY FOR EV ##OL ##VING LATE ##N ##T FA ##CUL ##T ##IES OF CR ##IME AND THE STE ##ADY VI ##T ##ALITY WITH WHICH THEY SUR ##V ##IVE THE HEAR ##SE AND SPEAK THEIR DEEP MOUTH ##ED MA ##L ##IGN ##ITIES IN EVERY NEW BORN GENER ##ATION HAVE ASS ##OC ##IA ##TED THEM SOME ##H ##OW IN MY MIND WITH A SPE ##LL OF LIFE EXC ##EE ##D ##ING AND DIST ##INCT FROM HUMAN AND A SPE ##CI ##AL SAT ##AN ##IC ACT ##ION
THE FLOOR MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE SHOW ##ED THE GREAT AGE OF THE ROOM
MY BED WAS UN ##E ##X ##CEPT ##ION ##ABLY COMFORT ##ABLE BUT IN MY THEN MO ##OD I COULD HAVE WISH ##ED IT A GREAT DEAL MORE MO ##DER ##N
ITS CUR ##TAIN ##S WERE OF THICK AND FA ##DE ##D T ##APE ##ST ##RY
ALL THE FUR ##N ##IT ##URE BELONG ##ED TO OTHER TIMES
I SH ##AN ' T TROUBLE YOU ABOUT MY TRA ##IN OF THOUGHTS OR FAN ##CI ##ES BUT I BEGAN TO FEEL VERY LIKE A GENTLEMAN IN A G ##H ##OST STORY WATCH ##ING EXPER ##IMENT ##ALLY IN A HA ##UNT ##ED CH ##AM ##BER
I DID NOT EVEN TAKE THE PRE ##C ##AUT ##ION OF SM ##OK ##ING UP THE CH ##IM ##NEY

A COLD BRIGHT MOON WAS SH ##INING WITH CLEAR SHAR ##P LIGHT ##S AND SHAD ##OWS
THE SOM ##BR ##E OLD TREES LIKE GI ##G ##ANT ##IC HEAR ##SE PL ##UM ##ES BLACK AND AW ##FUL
SOME ##H ##OW I HAD GR ##OWN NE ##R ##V ##OUS
A LITTLE BIT OF PLA ##STER T ##UMB ##LED DOWN THE CH ##IM ##NEY AND START ##LED ME CONF ##OUNDED ##LY
IT WAS NOT VERY MUCH PAST ELE ##VEN THAT MORNING WHEN THE PO ##NY CAR ##RIAGE FROM BRA ##NDON DREW UP BEFORE THE LITTLE GARDEN W ##ICK ##ET OF RED ##MAN ' S FAR ##M

WOMEN CAN H ##IDE THEIR PAIN BETTER THAN WE MEN AND BEAR IT BETTER TOO EXCEPT WHEN SH ##AME DRO ##PS FIRE INTO THE DR ##EAD ##FUL CH ##AL ##ICE

THIS TRANS ##IENT SPR ##ING AND LIGHT ##ING UP ARE BEAUTIFUL A GL ##AM ##OUR BEG ##U ##ILING OUR SENSE ##S
THERE WAS SOMETHING OF SWEET ##NESS AND FO ##ND ##NESS IN HER TONE ##S AND MANNER WHICH WAS NEW TO RA ##CH ##EL AND COMFORT ##ING AND SHE RETURNED THE GRE ##ET ##ING AS KIND ##LY AND FELT MORE LIKE HER FORM ##ER SELF
RA ##CH ##EL ' S PAL ##E AND SHAR ##PE ##NED FE ##AT ##URES AND D ##IL ##ATED EYE STRUCK HER WITH A PAIN ##FUL SURPR ##ISE

HE DID NOT THINK OF THE WARM SUN AND OF THE FRE ##SH AIR HE DID NOT CARE FOR THE LITTLE CO ##T ##T ##AGE CHILDREN THAT RAN ABOUT AND PR ##AT ##TLE ##D WHEN THEY WERE IN THE WOOD ##S LOOKING FOR WILD STRA ##W ##BER ##RIE ##S
BUT THIS WAS WHAT THE TREE COULD NOT BEAR TO HEAR

OH THAT MADE HIM SO ANG ##RY
TO GR ##OW AND GR ##OW TO GET OLD ##ER AND BE T ##ALL THOUGHT THE TREE THAT AFTER ALL IS THE MOST DELIGHT ##FUL THING IN THE WORLD

BUT THE TREE DID NOT RE ##J ##O ##ICE AT ALL HE GREW AND GREW AND WAS GREEN BOTH WIN ##TER AND SUM ##MER
AND TOWARDS CHRIST ##MA ##S HE WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THAT WAS CUT DOWN
THE A ##X ##E STRUCK DEEP INTO THE VERY P ##ITH THE TREE FELL TO THE EARTH WITH A S ##IGH HE FELT A PA ##NG IT WAS LIKE A SW ##OON HE COULD NOT THINK OF HAPP ##INESS FOR HE WAS SO ##R ##RO ##W ##FUL AT BEING SE ##PAR ##ATED FROM HIS HOME FROM THE PLACE WHERE HE HAD SPR ##UNG UP
HE WELL KNEW THAT HE SHOULD NEVER SEE HIS DEAR OLD COM ##RA ##DE ##S THE LITTLE BUS ##H ##ES AND FLO ##W ##ERS AROUND HIM ANY ##M ##ORE PERHAPS NOT EVEN THE BIRD ##S
THE DEP ##ART ##URE WAS NOT AT ALL AG ##REE ##ABLE
THE TREE ONLY CAME TO HIMSELF WHEN HE WAS UN ##L ##O ##ADE ##D IN A COURT Y ##ARD WITH THE OTHER TREES AND HEARD A MAN SAY THAT ONE IS SP ##LE ##ND ##ID WE DON ' T WANT THE OTHERS
THERE TOO WERE LARGE EAS ##Y CHAIR ##S SIL ##KE ##N SO ##F ##AS LARGE TABLE ##S FULL OF PICT ##URE BOOK ##S AND FULL OF TO ##YS WORTH HUNDRED ##S AND HUNDRED ##S OF CROW ##N ##S AT LEAST THE CHILDREN SAID SO
THE SERV ##ANTS AS WELL AS THE YOUNG LAD ##IES DEC ##OR ##ATED IT
THIS EVENING THEY ALL SAID
HOW IT WILL SH ##INE THIS EVENING
PERHAPS THE OTHER TREES FROM THE FOREST WILL COME TO LOOK AT ME
IT BLA ##Z ##ED UP FAM ##OUSLY HELP HELP
CRIED THE YOUNG LAD ##IES AND THEY QUICKLY PUT OUT THE FIRE
A STORY
A STORY CRIED THE CHILDREN DRAW ##ING A LITTLE FAT MAN TOWARDS THE TREE
BUT I SHALL TELL ONLY ONE STORY
HUM ##P ##Y DU ##M ##P ##Y FELL DOWN ##ST ##AIRS AND YET HE MAR ##RIED THE PRINCESS
THAT ' S THE WAY OF THE WORLD
THOUGHT THE FIR TREE AND BELIEVE ##D IT ALL BECAUSE THE MAN WHO TOLD THE STORY WAS SO GOOD LOOKING WELL WELL
I WON ' T TRE ##MB ##LE TO MOR ##RO ##W THOUGHT THE FIR TREE
AND THE WHOLE NIGHT THE TREE STOOD STILL AND IN DEEP THOUGHT
IN THE MORNING THE SERV ##ANT AND THE HOUSE ##MA ##ID CAME IN
BUT THEY DRA ##GG ##ED HIM OUT OF THE ROOM AND UP THE ST ##AIRS INTO THE LO ##FT AND HERE IN A DARK CORN ##ER WHERE NO DAY ##L ##IGHT COULD ENTER THEY LEFT HIM
WHAT ' S THE MEAN ##ING OF THIS THOUGHT THE TREE
AND HE LEA ##NED AGAINST THE WALL LOST IN REV ##ER ##IE
TIME ENOUGH HAD HE TOO FOR HIS REF ##LE ##CTION ##S FOR DAYS AND NIGHT ##S PASSED ON AND NO ##BODY CAME UP AND WHEN AT LAST SOME ##BODY DID COME IT WAS ONLY TO PUT SOME GREAT TR ##UN ##KS IN A CORN ##ER OUT OF THE WAY
T ##IS NOW WIN ##TER OUT OF DOOR ##S THOUGHT THE TREE
HOW KIND MAN IS AFTER ALL
IF IT ONLY WERE NOT SO DARK HERE AND SO TERRI ##B ##LY LO ##NE ##LY
SQU ##E ##AK SQU ##E ##AK
THEY SN ##UFF ##ED ABOUT THE FIR TREE AND RU ##ST ##LED AMONG THE BRA ##N ##CHES
I AM BY NO MEANS OLD SAID THE FIR TREE
THERE ' S MANY A ONE CONSIDER ##ABLY OLD ##ER THAN I AM
THEY WERE SO EXT ##RE ##ME ##LY CUR ##IOUS
I KNOW NO SUCH PLACE SAID THE TREE
AND THEN HE TOLD ALL ABOUT HIS YOUTH AND THE LITTLE M ##ICE HAD NEVER HEARD THE LIKE BEFORE AND THEY LIST ##ENED AND SAID
SAID THE FIR TREE THINKING OVER WHAT HE HAD HIMSELF REL ##ATED
YES IN REAL ##ITY THOSE WERE HAPPY TIMES
WHO IS HUM ##P ##Y DU ##M ##P ##Y ASKED THE M ##ICE
ONLY THAT ONE ANSWERED THE TREE
IT IS A VERY ST ##UP ##ID STORY
DON ' T YOU KNOW ONE ABOUT B ##AC ##ON AND T ##ALL ##OW CAN ##DLE ##S CAN ' T YOU TELL ANY LAR ##DER STO ##RIE ##S
NO SAID THE TREE
THEN GOOD BY ##E SAID THE RA ##TS AND THEY WENT HOME
AT LAST THE LITTLE M ##ICE STAY ##ED AWAY ALSO AND THE TREE S ##IGH ##ED AFTER ALL IT WAS VERY PLEAS ##ANT WHEN THE SLE ##E ##K LITTLE M ##ICE SAT ROUND ME AND LIST ##ENED TO WHAT I TOLD THEM
NOW THAT TOO IS OVER
WHY ONE MORNING THERE CAME A QU ##ANT ##ITY OF PEOPLE AND SET TO WORK IN THE LO ##FT
THE TR ##UN ##KS WERE MOVE ##D THE TREE WAS PULL ##ED OUT AND THR ##OWN RATHER HARD IT IS TRUE DOWN ON THE FLOOR BUT A MAN DREW HIM TOWARDS THE ST ##AIRS WHERE THE DAY ##L ##IGHT SHO ##NE
BUT IT WAS NOT THE FIR TREE THAT THEY MEANT
IT WAS IN A CORN ##ER THAT HE LAY AMONG WEE ##D ##S AND NE ##T ##TLE ##S
THE GOLD ##EN ST ##AR OF T ##INS ##EL WAS STILL ON THE TOP OF THE TREE AND GL ##ITT ##ERED IN THE SUN ##SH ##INE
IN THE COURT Y ##ARD SOME OF THE MER ##RY CHILDREN WERE PLAY ##ING WHO HAD DA ##N ##CED AT CHRIST ##MA ##S ROUND THE FIR TREE AND WERE SO GLAD AT THE SIGHT OF HIM
AND THE GARDEN ##ER ' S BOY CH ##OP ##PE ##D THE TREE INTO SMALL PIE ##CES THERE WAS A WHOLE HEA ##P L ##YING THERE
THE WOOD FL ##AMED UP SP ##LE ##ND ##ID ##LY UNDER THE LARGE BRE ##W ##ING CO ##PPER AND IT S ##IGH ##ED SO DEEP ##LY
HOWEVER THAT WAS OVER NOW THE TREE GONE THE STORY AT AN END
KE ##N ##NE ##TH AND BET ##H REF ##RA ##INED FROM TELL ##ING THE OTHER GIRLS OR UNCLE JOHN OF OLD WILL RO ##GER ##S ' S VISIT BUT THEY GOT MISTER WAT ##SON IN THE LI ##BR ##ARY AND QUESTION ##ED HIM CLOSE ##LY ABOUT THE PEN ##AL ##TY FOR FORG ##ING A CHE ##CK
IT WAS A SER ##IOUS CR ##IME INDEED MISTER WAT ##SON TOLD THEM AND TOM G ##ATES BAD ##E FAIR TO SERV ##E A LENGTH ##Y TER ##M IN STATE ' S PRISON AS A CONSE ##QU ##ENCE OF HIS RA ##SH ACT
I CAN ' T SEE IT IN THAT LIGHT SAID THE OLD LAW ##Y ##ER
IT WAS A DEL ##IB ##ER ##ATE THE ##FT FROM HIS EM ##PL ##OY ##ERS TO PROT ##ECT A GIRL HE LOVED
BUT THEY COULD NOT HAVE PROV ##EN A CASE AGAINST LU ##CY IF SHE WAS INN ##OC ##ENT AND ALL THEIR THR ##E ##ATS OF ARR ##EST ##ING HER WERE PROB ##ABLY MERE BL ##UFF
HE WAS SOFT HEART ##ED AND IMP ##ET ##U ##OUS SAID BET ##H AND BEING IN LOVE HE DIDN ' T STO ##P TO COUNT THE CO ##ST
IF THE PRO ##SE ##C ##UTION WERE WITH ##D ##RA ##WN AND THE CASE SET ##TLE ##D WITH THE VICT ##IM OF THE FORG ##ED CHE ##CK THEN THE YOUNG MAN WOULD BE ALL ##OWED HIS FREE ##D ##OM
BUT UNDER THE CIRCUMST ##ANCES I DOUBT IF SUCH AN ARR ##ANGE ##MENT COULD BE MADE
FAIR ##V ##IEW WAS TW ##ELVE MILES AWAY BUT BY TEN O ' CLOCK THEY DREW UP AT THE COUNT ##Y J ##AIL

OLD WILL IS A FINE FELLOW BUT POOR AND HELP ##LESS SINCE MISSUS RO ##GER ##S HAD HER ACC ##IDENT
THEN RO ##GER ##S WOULD ##N ' T DO ANYTHING BUT LEAD HER AROUND AND WAIT UPON HER AND THE PLACE WENT TO RA ##CK AND RU ##IN
HE SPOKE SIM ##PLY BUT PA ##CED UP AND DOWN THE N ##ARR ##OW CE ##LL IN FRONT OF THEM
WHOSE NAME DID YOU SIGN TO THE CHE ##CK ASKED KE ##N ##NE ##TH
HE IS SUPPOSE ##D TO SIGN ALL THE CHE ##CK ##S OF THE CONCER ##N
IT ' S A STO ##CK COMPANY AND RICH
I WAS BOOK ##KE ##EP ##ER SO IT WAS EAS ##Y TO GET A BLA ##N ##K CHE ##CK AND FORG ##E THE SIGN ##AT ##URE
AS REGARD ##S MY ROB ##B ##ING THE COMPANY I ' LL SAY THAT I SAVE ##D THEM A HEAVY LO ##S ##S ONE DAY
I DISCOVER ##ED AND PUT OUT A FIRE THAT WOULD HAVE DEST ##RO ##Y ##ED THE WHOLE PLAN ##T BUT MAR ##SH ##ALL NEVER EVEN THAN ##KED ME

I ' M GOING TO SEE MISTER MAR ##SH ##ALL SAID KE ##N ##NE ##TH AND DISCOVER WHAT I CAN DO TO ASS ##IST YOU THAN ##K YOU SIR
IT WON ' T BE MUCH BUT I ' M GRA ##TE ##FUL TO FIND A FRIEND

BET ##H UN ##E ##AS ##Y AT HIS SILENCE N ##UD ##GED HIM
THERE WAS A GR ##IM SMILE OF AM ##USE ##MENT ON HIS SH ##REW ##D FACE
HE MIGHT HAVE HAD THAT FORG ##ED CHE ##CK FOR THE FACE OF IT IF HE ' D BEEN SHAR ##P
AND TO THINK WE CAN SAVE ALL THAT MIS ##ERY AND DESP ##AIR BY THE PAY ##MENT OF A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DO ##LL ##ARS
SO TO THE SURPR ##ISE OF THE DEM ##OC ##RA ##T ##IC COMM ##ITT ##EE AND ALL HIS FRIENDS MISTER HOP ##K ##INS ANN ##OUN ##CED THAT HE WOULD OPP ##OSE FOR ##BE ##S ' S AG ##GR ##ESS ##IVE CAMP ##A ##IGN WITH AN EQU ##AL AG ##GR ##ESS ##IVE ##NESS AND SPE ##ND AS MANY DO ##LL ##ARS IN DOING SO AS MIGHT BE NECESSARY
ONE OF MISTER HOP ##K ##INS ' S FIRST T ##ASK ##S AFTER CALL ##ING HIS FAITH ##FUL HEN ##CH ##MEN AROUND HIM WAS TO MAKE A CARE ##FUL CAN ##V ##ASS OF THE VO ##TERS OF HIS DIST ##RIC ##T TO SEE WHAT WAS STILL TO BE ACCOM ##PL ##ISHED

THE TW ##IN BROTHER DID SOMETHING SHE DIDN ' T LIKE AND SHE TURNED HIS PICT ##URE TO THE WALL

OH LET HIM COME ALONG SHE U ##R ##GED I DO LOVE TO SEE HIM ABOUT THAT OLD HOUSE
HE MAKES IT SORT OF CO ##Z ##IER
NOW LET ' S DU ##ST THE FUR ##N ##IT ##URE AND PICT ##URES
YET LITTLE AS IT WAS IT HAD ALREADY MADE A V ##AST DIFFER ##ENCE IN THE AS ##PECT OF THE ROOM
SUR ##F ##ACE DU ##ST AT LEAST HAD BEEN REM ##OVE ##D AND THE FINE OLD FUR ##N ##IT ##URE GAVE A H ##INT OF ITS REAL ELE ##G ##ANCE AND POL ##ISH
THEN SHE SUDDENLY REMARK ##ED
AND MY POCK ##ET MONEY IS GETTING LOW AGAIN AND YOU HAVE ##N ' T ANY LEFT AS US ##UAL
THEY SAY ILL ##UM ##INATION BY CAN ##DLE LIGHT IS THE PRET ##T ##IEST IN THE WORLD
WHY IT ' S GO ##L ##IA ##TH AS US ##UAL THEY BOTH CRIED PE ##ERING IN
IS ##N ' T HE THE GREAT ##EST FOR GETTING INTO O ##D ##D CORN ##ERS
FORG ##ET ##TING ALL THEIR WE ##AR ##INESS THEY SE ##IZED THEIR CAN ##DLE ##S AND SC ##UR ##RIED THROUGH THE HOUSE FIND ##ING AN OCCASION ##AL PAPER T ##UCK ##ED AWAY IN SOME O ##D ##D CORN ##ER
WELL I ' M CONV ##INCE ##D THAT THE BO ##ARD ##ED UP HOUSE MY ##STER ##Y HAPPENED NOT EAR ##L ##IER THAN AP ##RI ##L SIX ##TEEN ##TH EIGHTEEN SIX ##TY ONE AND PROB ##ABLY NOT MUCH LATER
NO WORDS WERE SPOKE ##N NO LA ##NG ##U ##AGE WAS UT ##TERED SAVE THAT OF WA ##ILING AND HIS ##S ##ING AND THAT SOME ##H ##OW WAS IND ##IST ##INCT AS IF IT EXIST ##ED IN FAN ##CY AND NOT IN REAL ##ITY
I HEARD A NO ##ISE BEHIND I TURNED AND SAW K ##A ##FF ##AR HIS BLACK EYES SH ##INING WHILE IN HIS HAND HE HELD A GL ##E ##AM ##ING KN ##IFE HE LI ##FT ##ED IT ABOVE HIS HEAD AS IF TO STRI ##KE BUT I HAD THE STRENGTH OF TEN MEN AND I HUR ##LED HIM FROM ME
ON ##WARD SAID A DIST ##ANT VOICE
NO SOUND BR ##OKE THE STILL ##NESS OF THE NIGHT
THE STORY OF ITS EV ##IL INFL ##UE ##N ##CE CAME BACK TO ME AND IN MY BE ##W ##ILD ##ERED COND ##ITION I WONDER ##ED WHETHER THERE WAS NOT SOME TRUTH IN WHAT HAD BEEN SAID
WHAT WAS THAT
WHAT THEN A HUMAN HAND LARGE AND SH ##APE ##LY APPEARED DIST ##INCT ##LY ON THE SUR ##F ##ACE OF THE PO ##ND
NOTHING MORE NOT EVEN THE WR ##IST TO WHICH IT MIGHT BE ATT ##ACH ##ED
IT DID NOT BEC ##K ##ON OR INDEED MOVE AT ALL IT WAS AS STILL AS THE HAND OF DEATH
I AW ##OKE TO CONS ##CIOUS ##NESS FIGHT ##ING AT FIRST IT SEEMED AS IF I WAS FIGHT ##ING WITH A PH ##ANT ##OM BUT GRA ##DU ##ALLY MY OPP ##ONE ##N ##T BECAME MORE REAL TO ME IT WAS K ##A ##FF ##AR
A SOUND OF VOICE ##S A FL ##ASH OF LIGHT
A FEELING OF FREE ##D ##OM AND I WAS AW ##AKE WHERE
SAID ANOTHER VOICE WHICH I RECO ##GN ##IZED AS VO ##LT ##AIR ##E ' S K ##A ##FF ##AR
I HAD SCARCE ##LY KNOWN WHAT I HAD BEEN SAYING OR DOING UP TO THIS TIME BUT AS HE SPOKE I LOOKED AT MY HAND
IN THE LIGHT OF THE MOON I SAW A KN ##IFE RED WITH BLOOD AND MY HAND TOO WAS ALSO DISC ##OL ##OUR ##ED
I DO NOT KNOW I AM DA ##Z ##ED BE ##W ##ILD ##ERED
BUT THAT IS K ##A ##FF ##AR ' S KN ##IFE
I KNOW HE HAD IT THIS VERY EVENING
I REMEMBER SAYING HAVE WE BEEN TOGETHER
VO ##LT ##AIR ##E P ##ICKED UP SOMETHING FROM THE GROUND AND LOOKED AT IT
I SAY YOU DO KNOW WHAT THIS MEANS AND YOU MUST TELL US
A TERRI ##BLE THOUGHT FL ##ASH ##ED INTO MY MIND
I HAD AGAIN BEEN ACT ##ING UNDER THE INFL ##UE ##N ##CE OF THIS MAN ' S POWER
PER ##CH ##ANCE TOO K ##A ##FF ##AR ' S DEATH MIGHT SERV ##E HIM IN GOOD STE ##AD
MY TO ##NG ##UE REF ##USED TO ART ##IC ##UL ##ATE MY POWER OF SPE ##E ##CH LEFT ME
MY POSITION WAS TOO TERRI ##BLE
MY OVER ##W ##RO ##UGHT NE ##R ##VES Y ##IELD ##ED AT LAST
FOR SOME TIME AFTER THAT I REMEMBER ##ED NOTHING DIST ##INCT ##LY
THE THREE MO ##DE ##S OF MAN ##AGE ##MENT
TO SUPPOSE THAT THE OBJECT OF THIS WORK IS TO A ##ID IN EFFECT ##ING SUCH A SUB ##ST ##IT ##UTION AS THAT IS ENTIRE ##LY TO MIST ##AKE ITS NATURE AND DES ##IGN
BY REASON AND AFF ##ECT ##ION
AS THE CH ##A ##ISE DRI ##VES AWAY MARY STAND ##S BE ##W ##ILD ##ERED AND PER ##PLE ##X ##ED ON THE DOOR STEP HER MIND IN A T ##UM ##ULT OF EXC ##ITE ##MENT IN WHICH HAT ##RED OF THE DOCTOR DIST ##RU ##ST AND SUS ##P ##IC ##ION OF HER MOTHER DISAPP ##OINT ##MENT VE ##X ##ATION AND ILL HUM ##OR SUR ##GE AND SWE ##LL AMONG THOSE DEL ##IC ##ATE OR ##G ##AN ##IZ ##ATIONS ON WHICH THE STR ##UCT ##URE AND DEV ##EL ##OP ##MENT OF THE SOUL SO CLOSE ##LY DEP ##END DOING PERHAPS AN IR ##RE ##PAR ##ABLE IN ##J ##URY
THE MOTHER AS SOON AS THE CH ##A ##ISE IS SO FAR TURNED THAT MARY CAN NO LONGER WATCH THE EXPRESS ##ION OF HER COUNT ##EN ##ANCE GO ##ES AWAY FROM THE DOOR WITH A SMILE OF COMP ##LA ##CE ##N ##CY AND SATISF ##ACT ##ION UPON HER FACE AT THE IN ##GE ##N ##U ##ITY AND SUCCESS OF HER LITTLE ART ##IFIC ##E
SO YOU WILL BE A GOOD GIRL I KNOW AND NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE BUT WILL STAY AT HOME CONT ##ENTED ##LY WON ' T YOU
THE MOTHER IN MAN ##AG ##ING THE CASE IN THIS WAY REL ##IES PART ##LY ON CONV ##IN ##CING THE REASON OF THE CHILD AND PART ##LY ON AN APP ##E ##AL TO HER AFF ##ECT ##ION
IF YOU SHOULD NOT BE A GOOD GIRL BUT SHOULD SHOW SIGN ##S OF MAKING US ANY TROUBLE I SHALL HAVE TO SEND YOU OUT SOME ##WHERE TO THE BACK PART OF THE HOUSE UNTIL WE ARE GONE
BUT THIS LAST SUPP ##OSITION IS ALMOST ALWAYS UN ##NE ##CESS ##ARY FOR IF MARY HAS BEEN HA ##BIT ##UALLY MAN ##AGED ON THIS PRINCI ##PLE SHE WILL NOT MAKE ANY TROUBLE
IT IS INDEED TRUE THAT THE IMPORT ##ANCE OF T ##ACT AND SK ##ILL IN THE TRA ##INING OF THE YOUNG AND OF C ##ULT ##IV ##ATING THEIR REASON AND SEC ##URING THEIR AFF ##ECT ##ION CAN NOT BE OVER ##RA ##TED
TO SUCH PERSON ##S THESE IND ##IRE ##CT MO ##DE ##S OF TRA ##INING CHILDREN IN HA ##BIT ##S OF SUB ##ORD ##INATION TO THEIR WILL OR RATHER OF Y ##IELD ##ING TO THEIR INFL ##UE ##N ##CE ARE SPE ##CI ##ALLY USE ##FUL
DEL ##LA HAD A YOUNG SISTER NAME ##D MAR ##IA AND A CO ##US ##IN WHOSE NAME WAS J ##ANE
NOW DEL ##IA CONTR ##IVE ##D TO OB ##TAIN A GREAT INFL ##UE ##N ##CE AND AS ##CE ##ND ##EN ##CY OVER THE MIND ##S OF THE CHILDREN BY MEANS OF THESE DO ##LL ##S
TO GIVE AN IDEA OF THESE CONVERS ##ATIONS I WILL REP ##ORT ONE OF THEM IN FULL
YOU HAVE COME AND ##ELL ##A AND ##ELL ##A WAS THE NAME OF J ##ANE ' S DO ##LL TO MAKE RO ##S ##AL ##IE A VISIT
I AM VERY GLAD
I EXPECT YOU HAVE BEEN A VERY GOOD GIRL AND ##ELL ##A SINCE YOU WERE HERE LAST
THEN TURN ##ING TO J ##ANE SHE ASKED IN A SOME ##WH ##AT AL ##TERED TONE HAS SHE BEEN A GOOD GIRL J ##ANE
FOR INST ##ANCE ONE DAY THE CHILDREN HAD BEEN PLAY ##ING UPON THE P ##IA ##Z ##Z ##A WITH BL ##OCK ##S AND OTHER PLAY ##THING ##S AND FIN ##ALLY HAD GONE INTO THE HOUSE LEA ##VING ALL THE THINGS ON THE FLOOR OF THE P ##IA ##Z ##Z ##A INSTEAD OF PUT ##TING THEM AWAY IN THEIR PLACE ##S AS THEY OUGHT TO HAVE DONE
THEY WERE NOW PLAY ##ING WITH THEIR DO ##LL ##S IN THE PAR ##L ##OR
DEL ##IA CAME TO THE PAR ##L ##OR AND WITH AN AIR OF GREAT MY ##STER ##Y BEC ##K ##ONE ##D THE CHILDREN AS ##IDE AND SAID TO THEM IN A WHIS ##PER LEAVE AND ##ELL ##A AND RO ##S ##AL ##IE HERE AND DON ' T SAY A WORD TO THEM
SO SAYING SHE LED THE WAY ON T ##IP ##TO ##E FOLLOWED BY THE CHILDREN OUT OF THE ROOM AND ROUND BY A CIRC ##U ##IT ##OUS RO ##UTE TO THE P ##IA ##Z ##Z ##A THERE
SAID SHE POINT ##ING TO THE PLAY ##THING ##S SEE
PUT THESE PLAY ##THING ##S ALL AWAY QUICK AND CARE ##FULLY AND WE WILL NOT LET THEM KNOW ANY THING ABOUT YOUR LEA ##VING THEM OUT
AND THIS MET ##H ##OD OF TREAT ##ING THE CASE WAS MUCH MORE EFFECT ##UAL IN MAKING THEM DISP ##OSED TO AV ##O ##ID COMM ##ITTING A SIM ##IL ##AR FA ##ULT ANOTHER TIME THAN ANY DIRECT RE ##B ##U ##KE ##S OR EXPRESS ##IONS OF DISP ##LE ##AS ##URE ADD ##RESSED PERSON ##ALLY TO THEM WOULD HAVE BEEN
NATURE OF THE EFFECT PRODU ##CED BY EARLY IMP ##RESS ##IONS
THAT IS COMP ##AR ##ATIVE ##LY NOTHING
THEY ARE CHIEF ##LY FORM ##ED FROM COM ##B ##INATION ##S OF THE IMP ##RESS ##IONS MADE IN CHILD ##HOOD
V ##AST IMPORT ##ANCE AND INFL ##UE ##N ##CE OF THIS MEN ##T ##AL FUR ##N ##ISH ##ING
WITHOUT GOING TO ANY SUCH EXT ##RE ##ME AS THIS WE CAN EAS ##ILY SEE ON REF ##LE ##CTION HOW V ##AST AN INFL ##UE ##N ##CE ON THE IDEA ##S AND CON ##CEPT ##IONS AS WELL AS ON THE PRINCI ##PLE ##S OF ACT ##ION IN MAT ##URE YEARS MUST BE EX ##ERT ##ED BY THE NATURE AND CHARACTER OF THE IMAG ##ES WHICH THE PER ##I ##OD OF INF ##AN ##CY AND CHILD ##HOOD IMP ##RESS ##ES UPON THE MIND
THE PAIN PRODU ##CED BY AN ACT OF HAST ##Y AND ANG ##RY VI ##OL ##ENCE TO WHICH A FATHER SUBJECT ##S HIS SON MAY SOON PASS AWAY BUT THE MEM ##ORY OF IT DOES NOT PASS AWAY WITH THE PAIN
BUT AND ##ERS CARE ##D NOTHING ABOUT THAT
HE MADE A BO ##W SO DEEP THAT HIS BACK CAME NEAR BREAK ##ING AND HE WAS DU ##MB ##F ##OUNDED I CAN TELL YOU WHEN HE SAW IT WAS NO ##BODY BUT AND ##ERS
HE WAS SUCH A BIG BOY THAT HE WOR ##E HIGH BO ##OTS AND CARRIED A J ##ACK KN ##IFE
NOW THIS KN ##IFE WAS A SP ##LE ##ND ##ID ONE THOUGH HALF THE BLA ##DE WAS GONE AND THE HAND ##LE WAS A LITTLE CRA ##CK ##ED AND AND ##ERS KNEW THAT ONE IS ALMOST A MAN AS SOON AS ONE HAS A J ##ACK KN ##IFE
YES WHY NOT THOUGHT AND ##ERS
SEEING THAT I AM SO FINE I MAY AS WELL GO AND VISIT THE KING
I AM GOING TO THE COURT B ##ALL ANSWERED AND ##ERS
AND SHE TOOK AND ##ERS HAND AND WALKED WITH HIM UP THE BR ##O ##AD MAR ##BLE ST ##AIRS WHERE SOLD ##IERS WERE POST ##ED AT EVERY THIRD STEP AND THROUGH THE MAG ##N ##IFIC ##ENT HALL ##S WHERE COURT ##IERS IN SIL ##K AND VE ##L ##VE ##T STOOD BO ##W ##ING WHERE ##VER HE WENT
FOR LIKE AS NOT THEY MUST HAVE THOUGHT HIM A PRINCE WHEN THEY SAW HIS FINE CAP
AT THE FAR ##THER END OF THE LARGE ##ST HALL A TABLE WAS SET WITH GOLD ##EN C ##UP ##S AND GOLD ##EN PLA ##TE ##S IN LONG RO ##W ##S
ON H ##UG ##E SIL ##VER PLA ##T ##TERS WERE P ##Y ##RA ##M ##ID ##S OF T ##ART ##S AND CA ##KE ##S AND RED WIN ##E SP ##ARK ##LED IN GL ##ITT ##ERING DEC ##ANT ##ERS
THE PRINCESS SAT DOWN UNDER A BLUE CAN ##OP ##Y WITH BO ##U ##QU ##ETS OF ROSE ##S AND SHE LET AND ##ERS SIT IN A GOLD ##EN CHAIR BY HER SIDE
BUT YOU MUST NOT EAT WITH YOUR CAP ON YOUR HEAD SHE SAID AND WAS GOING TO TAKE IT OFF
THE PRINCESS CERTAINLY WAS BEAUTIFUL AND HE WOULD HAVE DEAR ##LY LIKE ##D TO BE K ##ISS ##ED BY HER BUT THE CAP WHICH HIS MOTHER HAD MADE HE WOULD NOT GIVE UP ON ANY COND ##ITION
HE ONLY SHO ##OK HIS HEAD
WELL BUT NOW SAID THE PRINCESS AND SHE FILLED HIS POCK ##ETS WITH CA ##KE ##S AND PUT HER OWN HEAVY GOLD CH ##AIN AROUND HIS NE ##CK AND BE ##N ##T DOWN AND K ##ISS ##ED HIM
THAT IS A VERY FINE CAP YOU HAVE HE SAID
SO IT IS SAID AND ##ERS
AND IT IS MADE OF MOTHER ' S BEST Y ##AR ##N AND SHE KN ##ITTED IT HERSELF AND EVERY ##BODY WANT ##S TO GET IT AWAY FROM ME
WITH ONE J ##UMP AND ##ERS GOT OUT OF HIS CHAIR
HE DA ##R ##TED LIKE AN ARR ##OW THROUGH ALL THE HALL ##S DOWN ALL THE ST ##AIRS AND ACROSS THE Y ##ARD
HE STILL HELD ON TO IT WITH BOTH HANDS AS HE RU ##SH ##ED INTO HIS MOTHER ' S CO ##T ##T ##AGE
AND ALL HIS BROTHER ##S AND SISTER ##S STOOD ROUND AND LIST ##ENED WITH THEIR MOUTH ##S OPEN
BUT WHEN HIS BIG BROTHER HEARD THAT HE HAD REF ##USED TO GIVE HIS CAP FOR A KING ' S GOLD ##EN CROW ##N HE SAID THAT AND ##ERS WAS A ST ##UP ##ID
AND ##ERS FACE GREW RED
BUT HIS MOTHER H ##UGG ##ED HIM CLOSE
NO MY LITTLE SON SHE SAID
IF YOU DRESS ##ED IN SIL ##K AND GOLD FROM TOP TO TO ##E YOU COULD NOT LOOK ANY N ##ICE ##R THAN IN YOUR LITTLE RED CAP
AT THE CON ##CL ##USION OF THE B ##AN ##QU ##ET WHICH WAS SERV ##ED AT FIVE O ' CLOCK THE KING ENTERED HIS CA ##B ##INE ##T WHERE HIS T ##AIL ##ORS WERE AW ##A ##ITING HIM FOR THE PURPOSE OF TRY ##ING ON THE CE ##LE ##BR ##ATED CO ##ST ##UM ##E REP ##RES ##ENT ##ING SPR ##ING WHICH WAS THE RES ##ULT OF SO MUCH IMAG ##INATION AND HAD CO ##ST SO MANY EFF ##ORT ##S OF THOUGHT TO THE DES ##IGN ##ERS AND OR ##N ##AME ##N ##T WORK ##ERS OF THE COURT
AH VERY WELL
LET HIM COME IN THEN SAID THE KING AND AS IF COL ##BERT HAD BEEN LIST ##ENING AT THE DOOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF KEEP ##ING HIMSELF A ##U COUR ##ANT WITH THE CONVERS ##ATION HE ENTERED AS SOON AS THE KING HAD PRO ##N ##OUN ##CED HIS NAME TO THE TWO COURT ##IERS
GENTLE ##MEN TO YOUR POST ##S WHERE ##UP ##ON SAINT A ##IGN ##AN AND VILL ##ER ##OY TOOK THEIR LEAVE
CERTAINLY SIR ##E BUT I MUST HAVE MONEY TO DO THAT WHAT
WHAT DO YOU MEAN INQU ##IRED LO ##U ##IS
HE HAS GIVEN THEM WITH TOO MUCH GRACE NOT TO HAVE OTHERS STILL TO GIVE IF THEY ARE REQU ##IRED WHICH IS THE CASE AT THE PRESENT MOMENT
IT IS NECESSARY THEREFORE THAT HE SHOULD COMP ##LY THE KING FR ##OWN ##ED
DOES YOUR MAJ ##EST ##Y THEN NO LONGER BELIEVE THE DIS ##L ##OY ##AL ATTEMPT
NOT AT ALL YOU ARE ON THE CONTR ##ARY MOST AG ##REE ##ABLE TO ME
YOUR MAJ ##EST ##Y ' S PLAN THEN IN THIS AFF ##AIR IS
YOU WILL TAKE THEM FROM MY PRIV ##ATE TRE ##AS ##URE
THE NEWS CIRC ##UL ##ATED WITH THE RAP ##ID ##ITY OF LIGHT ##NING DURING ITS PRO ##GR ##ESS IT KIND ##LED EVERY VAR ##IET ##Y OF CO ##QU ##ET ##RY DESIRE AND WILD AM ##BIT ##ION
THE KING HAD COMPLE ##TED HIS TO ##ILE ##T ##TE BY N ##INE O ' CLOCK HE APPEARED IN AN OPEN CAR ##RIAGE DEC ##OR ##ATED WITH BRA ##N ##CHES OF TREES AND FLO ##W ##ERS
THE QUEEN ##S HAD TAKEN THEIR SEA ##TS UPON A MAG ##N ##IFIC ##ENT D ##IA ##S OR PLA ##T ##FORM ER ##ECT ##ED UPON THE BO ##R ##DER ##S OF THE LA ##KE IN A THE ##ATER OF WONDER ##FUL ELE ##G ##ANCE OF CONST ##RU ##CTION
SUDDENLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF REST ##OR ##ING PEACE AND ORDER SPR ##ING ACCOM ##P ##AN ##IED BY HIS WHOLE COURT MADE HIS APPEAR ##ANCE
THE SEA ##SON ##S ALL ##IES OF SPR ##ING FOLLOWED HIM CLOSE ##LY TO FORM A QU ##AD ##RI ##LL ##E WHICH AFTER MANY WORDS OF MORE OR LESS FL ##ATTER ##ING IMPORT WAS THE COMM ##ENCE ##MENT OF THE DA ##N ##CE
HIS LEG ##S THE BEST SH ##APE ##D AT COURT WERE DISP ##LA ##Y ##ED TO GREAT ADV ##ANT ##AGE IN FLE ##SH COL ##ORED SIL ##KE ##N HO ##SE OF SIL ##K SO FINE AND SO TRANS ##PAR ##ENT THAT IT SEEMED ALMOST LIKE FLE ##SH ITSELF
THERE WAS SOMETHING IN HIS CAR ##RIAGE WHICH RES ##EM ##BLE ##D THE BU ##OY ##ANT MOVE ##MENTS OF AN IM ##M ##ORT ##AL AND HE DID NOT DA ##N ##CE SO MUCH AS SEEM TO SO ##AR ALONG
YES IT IS SUPP ##RESSED
FAR FROM IT SIR ##E YOUR MAJ ##EST ##Y HAVING GIVEN NO DIRECT ##IONS ABOUT IT THE MUS ##IC ##IANS HAVE RET ##AINED IT
YES SIR ##E AND READY DRESS ##ED FOR THE B ##ALL ##ET

THE KING SEEMED ONLY PLEASE ##D WITH EVERY ONE PRESENT
MON ##S ##IE ##UR WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO DID NOT UNDERSTAND ANYTHING ABOUT THE MATTER
THE B ##ALL ##ET BEGAN THE EFFECT WAS MORE THAN BEAUTIFUL
WHEN THE MUS ##IC BY ITS BUR ##ST ##S OF ME ##L ##OD ##Y CARRIED AWAY THESE ILL ##UST ##RI ##OUS DA ##N ##CER ##S WHEN THE SIM ##PLE UNT ##UT ##ORED PA ##N ##TO ##M ##IME OF THAT PER ##I ##OD ONLY THE MORE NATURAL ON ACCOUNT OF THE VERY IND ##IFF ##ERE ##N ##T ACT ##ING OF THE A ##UG ##UST ACT ##ORS HAD REACHED ITS C ##UL ##M ##IN ##ATING POINT OF TRI ##UMP ##H THE THE ##ATER SHO ##OK WITH T ##UM ##ULT ##U ##OUS APP ##LA ##USE

YOUR PLAY MUST BE NOT MERE ##LY A GOOD PLAY BUT A SUCCESS ##FUL ONE
FR ##ANK ##LY I CANNOT ALWAYS SAY

I ' VE GOT A LITTLE IDEA FOR A PLAY ABOUT A MAN AND A WOMAN AND ANOTHER WOMAN AND BUT PERHAPS I ' D BETTER KEEP THE PL ##OT A SECRET FOR THE MOMENT
ANY ##H ##OW IT ' S JO ##LLY EXC ##ITING AND I CAN DO THE D ##IAL ##OG ##UE ALL RIGHT

INDEED IR ##RES ##OL ##UTION BEING THE KE ##Y ##NOT ##E OF HA ##M ##LE ##T ' S SOL ##IL ##O ##QU ##Y A CLE ##VER PLAY ##ER COULD TO SOME EXT ##ENT IND ##IC ##ATE THE WHOLE THIRTY LINE ##S BY A SIL ##ENT WORK ##ING OF THE J ##AW BUT AT THE SAME TIME IT WOULD BE I ##DLE TO DEN ##Y THAT HE WOULD MISS THE FINE ##R SHAD ##ES OF THE DRA ##MA ##T ##IST ' S MEAN ##ING

THIS WOULD BE AN EAS ##Y WAY OF DOING IT BUT IT WOULD NOT BE THE BEST WAY FOR THE REASON THAT IT IS TOO EAS ##Y TO CALL ATTENTION TO ITSELF
IN THE OLD BAD ##LY MADE PLAY IT WAS FRE ##QU ##ENTLY NECESSARY FOR ONE OF THE CHARACTER ##S TO TAKE THE A ##UD ##IENCE INTO HIS CONF ##IDENCE

THE SC ##OTT ##ISH GENERAL ##S AND COMM ##ISS ##ION ##ERS AFF ##ECT ##ED GREAT SURPR ##ISE ON THE APPEAR ##ANCE OF THE KING AND THOUGH THEY PA ##ID HIM ALL THE EXT ##ER ##IOR RESPECT DU ##E TO HIS D ##IGN ##ITY THEY INST ##ANTLY SET A GU ##ARD UPON HIM UNDER COL ##OR OF PROT ##ECT ##ION AND MADE HIM IN REAL ##ITY A PRISON ##ER
THEY INFORM ##ED THE ENGLISH PAR ##L ##IAM ##ENT OF THIS UN ##E ##X ##PECT ##ED INC ##IDENT AND ASS ##URED THEM THAT THEY HAD ENTERED INTO NO PRIV ##ATE TREAT ##Y WITH THE KING

IF ANY STILL RET ##AINED RAN ##CO ##R AGAINST HIM IN HIS PRESENT COND ##ITION THEY PASSED IN SILENCE WHILE HIS WELL WISH ##ERS MORE GENER ##OUS THAN PR ##UDE ##N ##T ACCOM ##P ##AN ##IED HIS MAR ##CH WITH TEARS WITH ACC ##LA ##MA ##T ##IONS AND WITH PRAY ##ERS FOR HIS SA ##FE ##TY
HIS DEATH IN THIS CON ##J ##UN ##CT ##URE WAS A PUBLIC MIS ##FORT ##UNE
THE AN ##AL ##YS ##IS OF KNOWLEDGE WILL OCC ##UP ##Y US UNTIL THE END OF THE THIR ##TEEN ##TH LE ##CT ##URE AND IS THE MOST DIFFIC ##ULT PART OF OUR WHOLE ENTER ##PR ##ISE
WHAT IS CALLED PER ##CEPT ##ION DIFFER ##S FROM SENS ##ATION BY THE FACT THAT THE SENS ##ATION ##AL IN ##GR ##ED ##IENT ##S BRING UP HA ##BIT ##UAL ASS ##OC ##IA ##TE ##S IMAG ##ES AND EXPECT ##ATIONS OF THEIR US ##UAL COR ##RE ##LA ##TE ##S ALL OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT ##IVE ##LY IND ##IST ##ING ##U ##ISH ##ABLE FROM THE SENS ##ATION
WHETHER OR NOT THIS PRINCI ##PLE IS LI ##ABLE TO EXCEPT ##IONS EVERY ##ONE WOULD AG ##REE THAT IS HAS A BR ##O ##AD ME ##AS ##URE OF TRUTH THOUGH THE WORD EXACT ##LY MIGHT SEEM AN OVER ##ST ##ATE ##MENT AND IT MIGHT SEEM MORE COR ##RE ##CT TO SAY THAT IDEA ##S APPRO ##X ##IM ##ATELY REP ##RES ##ENT IMP ##RESS ##IONS
AND WHAT SORT OF EV ##IDENCE IS LO ##G ##ICALLY POSSIBLE
THERE IS NO LO ##G ##ICAL IMPOSS ##IB ##ILITY IN THE H ##Y ##P ##OTH ##ES ##IS THAT THE WORLD SPR ##ANG INTO BEING FIVE MINUTES AGO EXACT ##LY AS IT THEN WAS WITH A PO ##P ##UL ##ATION THAT REMEMBER ##ED A WHO ##LLY UN ##RE ##AL PAST
ALL THAT I AM DOING IS TO USE ITS LO ##G ##ICAL TEN ##AB ##ILITY AS A HELP IN THE AN ##AL ##YS ##IS OF WHAT OCC ##UR ##S WHEN WE REMEMBER
THE BEH ##AV ##I ##OUR ##IST WHO ATTEMPT ##S TO MAKE P ##S ##Y ##CH ##OL ##OG ##Y A RECO ##R ##D OF BEH ##AV ##I ##OUR HAS TO TR ##UST HIS MEM ##ORY IN MAKING THE RECO ##R ##D
HA ##BIT IS A CON ##CEPT INV ##OL ##VING THE OCC ##UR ##REN ##CE OF SIM ##IL ##AR EVEN ##TS AT DIFFERENT TIMES IF THE BEH ##AV ##I ##OUR ##IST FEEL ##S CONF ##IDENT THAT THERE IS SUCH A PH ##EN ##OME ##N ##ON AS HA ##BIT THAT CAN ONLY BE BECAUSE HE TR ##UST ##S HIS MEM ##ORY WHEN IT ASS ##URES HIM THAT THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER TIMES
BUT I DO NOT THINK SUCH AN INF ##ERE ##N ##CE IS WAR ##RA ##N ##TED
OUR CONF ##IDENCE OR LA ##CK OF CONF ##IDENCE IN THE ACC ##UR ##AC ##Y OF A MEM ##ORY IMAG ##E MUST IN F ##UND ##AME ##N ##T ##AL CASE ##S BE B ##ASED UPON A CHARACTER ##IST ##IC OF THE IMAG ##E ITSELF SINCE WE CANNOT EV ##OKE THE PAST BO ##D ##ILY AND COMP ##ARE IT WITH THE PRESENT IMAG ##E
WE SOMETIMES HAVE IMAG ##ES THAT ARE BY NO MEANS PE ##CUL ##IAR ##LY V ##AG ##UE WHICH YET WE DO NOT TR ##UST FOR EXAM ##PLE UNDER THE INFL ##UE ##N ##CE OF FAT ##IG ##UE WE MAY SEE A FRIEND ' S FACE VI ##V ##ID ##LY AND CLEAR ##LY BUT HOR ##RIB ##LY DIST ##ORT ##ED
SOME IMAG ##ES LIKE SOME SENS ##ATIONS FEEL VERY FAM ##IL ##IAR WHILE OTHERS FEEL STRANGE
FAM ##IL ##IAR ##ITY IS A FEELING CAP ##ABLE OF DE ##GR ##EE ##S
IN AN IMAG ##E OF A WELL KNOWN FACE FOR EXAM ##PLE SOME PART ##S MAY FEEL MORE FAM ##IL ##IAR THAN OTHERS WHEN THIS HAPP ##ENS WE HAVE MORE BELIE ##F IN THE ACC ##UR ##AC ##Y OF THE FAM ##IL ##IAR PART ##S THAN IN THAT OF THE UN ##F ##AM ##IL ##IAR PART ##S
I COME NOW TO THE OTHER CHARACTER ##IST ##IC WHICH MEM ##ORY IMAG ##ES MUST HAVE IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
THEY MUST HAVE SOME CHARACTER ##IST ##IC WHICH MAKES US REGARD THEM AS REF ##ER ##RI ##NG TO MORE OR LESS REM ##OTE PORT ##IONS OF THE PAST
IN ACT ##UAL FACT THERE ARE DOUBT ##LESS VAR ##IOUS FACT ##ORS THAT CON ##C ##UR IN GI ##VING US THE FEELING OF GREAT ##ER OR LESS REM ##OTE ##NESS IN SOME REMEMBER ##ED EVEN ##T
THERE MAY BE A SPE ##CI ##F ##IC FEELING WHICH COULD BE CALLED THE FEELING OF PAST ##NESS ES ##PE ##CI ##ALLY WHERE IMMEDI ##ATE MEM ##ORY IS CONCER ##NED
THERE IS OF COURSE A DIFFER ##ENCE BETWEEN KNOW ##ING THE TEM ##P ##OR ##AL REL ##ATION OF A REMEMBER ##ED EVEN ##T TO THE PRESENT AND KNOW ##ING THE TIME ORDER OF TWO REMEMBER ##ED EVEN ##TS
IT WOULD SEEM THAT ONLY RATHER REC ##ENT EVEN ##TS CAN BE PLACED AT ALL ACC ##UR ##ATELY BY MEANS OF FEELING ##S GI ##VING THEIR TEM ##P ##OR ##AL REL ##ATION TO THE PRESENT BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT SUCH FEELING ##S MUST PLAY AN ES ##SE ##N ##T ##IAL PART IN THE PRO ##CESS OF DA ##TING REMEMBER ##ED EVEN ##TS
IF WE HAD RET ##AINED THE SUBJECT OR ACT IN KNOWLEDGE THE WHOLE PROB ##LE ##M OF MEM ##ORY WOULD HAVE BEEN COMP ##AR ##ATIVE ##LY SIM ##PLE
REMEMBER ##ING HAS TO BE A PRESENT OCC ##UR ##REN ##CE IN SOME WAY RES ##EM ##B ##LING OR REL ##ATED TO WHAT IS REMEMBER ##ED
SOME POINT ##S MAY BE TAKEN AS FIX ##ED AND SUCH AS ANY THE ##ORY OF MEM ##ORY MUST ARRI ##VE AT
IN THIS CASE AS IN MOST OTHERS WHAT MAY BE TAKEN AS CERTAIN IN ADV ##ANCE IS RATHER V ##AG ##UE
THE FIRST OF OUR V ##AG ##UE BUT IND ##UB ##IT ##ABLE DA ##T ##A IS THAT THERE IS KNOWLEDGE OF THE PAST
WE MIGHT PROV ##IS ##ION ##ALLY THOUGH PERHAPS NOT QUITE COR ##RE ##CT ##LY DEF ##INE MEM ##ORY AS THAT WAY OF KNOW ##ING ABOUT THE PAST WHICH HAS NO AN ##AL ##OG ##UE IN OUR KNOWLEDGE OF THE F ##UT ##URE SUCH A DEF ##IN ##ITION WOULD AT LEAST SERV ##E TO MAR ##K THE PROB ##LE ##M WITH WHICH WE ARE CONCER ##NED THOUGH SOME EXPECT ##ATIONS MAY DES ##ER ##VE TO RAN ##K WITH MEM ##ORY AS REGARD ##S IMMEDI ##AC ##Y
THIS DIST ##INCT ##ION IS VI ##T ##AL TO THE UNDERSTAND ##ING OF MEM ##ORY BUT IT IS NOT SO EAS ##Y TO CARRY OUT IN PRACT ##ICE AS IT IS TO DRAW IN THE ##ORY
A GRA ##M ##OP ##H ##ONE BY THE HELP OF SU ##IT ##ABLE RECO ##R ##D ##S MIGHT REL ##ATE TO US THE INC ##IDENT ##S OF ITS PAST AND PEOPLE ARE NOT SO DIFFERENT FROM GRA ##M ##OP ##H ##ONES AS THEY LIKE TO BELIEVE
I CAN SET TO WORK NOW TO REMEMBER THINGS I NEVER REMEMBER ##ED BEFORE SUCH AS WHAT I HAD TO EAT FOR BREAK ##F ##AST THIS MORNING AND IT CAN HARDLY BE WHO ##LLY HA ##BIT THAT EN ##ABLE ##S ME TO DO THIS
THE FACT THAT A MAN CAN REC ##ITE A PO ##EM DOES NOT SHOW THAT HE REMEMBER ##S ANY PRE ##V ##IOUS OCCASION ON WHICH HE HAS REC ##ITED OR READ IT
SE ##M ##ON ' S TWO BOOK ##S MEN ##T ##ION ##ED IN AN EAR ##L ##IER LE ##CT ##URE DO NOT TOU ##CH KNOWLEDGE MEM ##ORY AT ALL CLOSE ##LY
THEY GIVE LAW ##S ACCORD ##ING TO WHICH IMAG ##ES OF PAST OCC ##UR ##REN ##CES COME INTO OUR MIND ##S BUT DO NOT DISC ##USS OUR BELIE ##F THAT THESE IMAG ##ES REF ##ER TO PAST OCC ##UR ##REN ##CES WHICH IS WHAT CONST ##IT ##UTES KNOWLEDGE MEM ##ORY
IT IS THIS THAT IS OF INTEREST TO THE ##ORY OF KNOWLEDGE
IT IS BY NO MEANS ALWAYS REL ##IA ##BLE ALMOST EVERY ##BODY HAS AT SOME TIME EXPER ##IENCE ##D THE WELL KNOWN ILL ##USION THAT ALL THAT IS HAPP ##ENING NOW HAPPENED BEFORE AT SOME TIME
WHEN ##EVER THE SENSE OF FAM ##IL ##IAR ##ITY OCC ##UR ##S WITHOUT A DEF ##IN ##ITE OBJECT IT LEAD ##S US TO SEA ##R ##CH THE EN ##V ##IR ##ON ##MENT UNTIL WE ARE SATISF ##IED THAT WE HAVE FOUND THE APPRO ##PR ##IA ##TE OBJECT WHICH LEAD ##S US TO THE JUD ##G ##MENT THIS IS FAM ##IL ##IAR
THUS NO KNOWLEDGE AS TO THE PAST IS TO BE DE ##RI ##VED FROM THE FEELING OF FAM ##IL ##IAR ##ITY ALONE
A FURTHER ST ##AGE IS RECO ##GN ##ITION
RECO ##GN ##ITION IN THIS SENSE DOES NOT NECESS ##AR ##ILY INV ##OL ##VE MORE THAN A HA ##BIT OF ASS ##OC ##IA ##T ##ION THE KIND OF OBJECT WE ARE SEEING AT THE MOMENT IS ASS ##OC ##IA ##TED WITH THE WORD CAT OR WITH AN A ##UD ##IT ##ORY IMAG ##E OF PUR ##RI ##NG OR WHATEVER OTHER CHARACTER ##IST ##IC WE MAY HAPP ##EN TO RECO ##GN ##IZE IN THE CAT OF THE MOMENT
WE ARE OF COURSE IN FACT ABLE TO JUD ##GE WHEN WE RECO ##GN ##IZE AN OBJECT THAT WE HAVE SEEN IT BEFORE BUT THIS JUD ##G ##MENT IS SOMETHING OVER AND ABOVE RECO ##GN ##ITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE AND MAY VERY PROB ##ABLY BE IMPOSS ##IBLE TO ANIM ##ALS THAT NEVER ##TH ##ELESS HAVE THE EXPER ##IENCE OF RECO ##GN ##ITION IN THIS FIRST SENSE OF THE WORD
THIS KNOWLEDGE IS MEM ##ORY IN ONE SENSE THOUGH IN ANOTHER IT IS NOT
THERE ARE HOWEVER SEVERAL POINT ##S IN WHICH SUCH AN ACCOUNT OF RECO ##GN ##ITION IS IN ##ADE ##QU ##ATE TO BEGIN WITH IT MIGHT SEEM AT FIRST SIGHT MORE COR ##RE ##CT TO DEF ##INE RECO ##GN ##ITION AS I HAVE SEEN THIS BEFORE THAN AS THIS HAS EXIST ##ED BEFORE
THE DEF ##IN ##ITION OF MY EXPER ##IENCE IS DIFFIC ##ULT BR ##O ##AD ##LY SPEAK ##ING IT IS EVERYTHING THAT IS CON ##NE ##CTED WITH WHAT I AM EXPER ##IE ##N ##CING NOW BY CERTAIN LI ##N ##KS OF WHICH THE VAR ##IOUS FORM ##S OF MEM ##ORY ARE AMONG THE MOST IMPORT ##ANT
THUS IF I RECO ##GN ##IZE A THING THE OCCASION OF ITS PRE ##V ##IOUS EXIST ##ENCE IN VI ##R ##T ##UE OF WHICH I RECO ##GN ##IZE IT FORM ##S PART OF MY EXPER ##IENCE BY DEF ##IN ##ITION RECO ##GN ##ITION WILL BE ONE OF THE MAR ##KS BY WHICH MY EXPER ##IENCE IS SING ##LED OUT FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD
OF COURSE THE WORDS THIS HAS EXIST ##ED BEFORE ARE A VERY IN ##ADE ##QU ##ATE TRANS ##LA ##T ##ION OF WHAT ACT ##UALLY HAPP ##ENS WHEN WE FORM A JUD ##G ##MENT OF RECO ##GN ##ITION BUT THAT IS UN ##AV ##O ##ID ##ABLE WORDS ARE FR ##AMED TO EXPRESS A LE ##VEL OF THOUGHT WHICH IS BY NO MEANS PR ##IM ##IT ##IVE AND ARE QUITE INC ##AP ##ABLE OF EXPRESS ##ING SUCH AN ELE ##MENT ##ARY OCC ##UR ##REN ##CE AS RECO ##GN ##ITION
I REM ##AINED THERE ALONE FOR MANY HOURS BUT I MUST AC ##K ##N ##OW ##LEDGE THAT BEFORE I LEFT THE CH ##AM ##BER ##S I HAD GRA ##DU ##ALLY BROUGHT MYSELF TO LOOK AT THE MATTER IN ANOTHER LIGHT
HAD EV ##A CRA ##SW ##ELL ##ER NOT BEEN GOOD LOOKING HAD J ##ACK BEEN STILL AT COLL ##E ##GE HAD SIR KE ##N ##NING ##TON O ##VAL REM ##AINED IN ENGLAND HAD MISTER BU ##N ##N ##IT AND THE BAR KEEP ##ER NOT SUCC ##EE ##DE ##D IN STO ##PPING MY CAR ##RIAGE ON THE HILL SHOULD I HAVE SUCC ##EE ##DE ##D IN ARR ##ANG ##ING FOR THE FIN ##AL DEP ##ART ##URE OF MY OLD FRIEND
ON ARRI ##VING AT HOME AT MY OWN RES ##IDENCE I FOUND THAT OUR SAL ##ON WAS FILLED WITH A BR ##ILL ##IAN ##T COMPANY
AS I SPOKE I MADE HIM A GRA ##CIOUS BO ##W AND I THINK I SHOW ##ED HIM BY MY MO ##DE OF ADD ##RESS THAT I DID NOT BEAR ANY GR ##UD ##GE AS TO MY IND ##IV ##ID ##UAL SELF
I HAVE COME TO YOUR SHO ##RES MISTER PRES ##IDENT WITH THE PURPOSE OF SEEING HOW THINGS ARE PRO ##GR ##ESS ##ING IN THIS DIST ##ANT QUAR ##TER OF THE WORLD
WE HAVE OUR LITTLE STR ##UGG ##LES HERE AS ELSE ##WHERE AND ALL THINGS CANNOT BE DONE BY ROSE WATER
WE ARE QUITE SATISF ##IED NOW CAPTAIN BAT ##TLE ##A ##X SAID MY WIFE
QUITE SATISF ##IED SAID EV ##A
THE LAD ##IES IN COMP ##L ##IAN ##CE WITH THAT SOFT ##NESS OF HEART WHICH IS THEIR CHARACTER ##IST ##IC ARE ON ONE SIDE AND THE MEN BY WHOM THE WORLD HAS TO BE MAN ##AGED ARE ON THE OTHER
NO DOUBT IN PRO ##CESS OF TIME THE LAD ##IES WILL FOLLOW
THEIR MASTER ##S SAID MISSUS NEVER ##BE ##ND
I DID NOT MEAN SAID CAPTAIN BAT ##TLE ##A ##X TO TOU ##CH UPON PUBLIC SUBJECT ##S AT SUCH A MOMENT AS THIS
MISSUS NEVER ##BE ##ND YOU MUST INDEED BE PRO ##UD OF YOUR SON
J ##ACK HAD BEEN STANDING IN THE FAR CORN ##ER OF THE ROOM TALK ##ING TO EV ##A AND WAS NOW RED ##U ##CED TO SILENCE BY HIS PR ##A ##ISE ##S
SIR KE ##N ##NING ##TON O ##VAL IS A VERY FINE PLAY ##ER SAID MY WIFE
I AND MY WIFE AND SON AND THE TWO CRA ##SW ##ELL ##ERS AND THREE OR FOUR OTHERS AG ##REE ##D TO DIN ##E ON BO ##ARD THE SHIP ON THE NEXT
THIS I FELT WAS PA ##ID TO ME AS BEING PRES ##IDENT OF THE REP ##UB ##LIC AND I END ##E ##AV ##OUR ##ED TO BEH ##AVE MYSELF WITH SUCH MIN ##G ##LED HUM ##ILITY AND D ##IGN ##ITY AS MIGHT BE ##F ##IT THE OCCASION BUT I COULD NOT BUT FEEL THAT SOMETHING WAS WANT ##ING TO THE SIM ##PL ##IC ##ITY OF MY ORD ##INARY LIFE
MY WIFE ON THE SP ##UR OF THE MOMENT MAN ##AGED TO GIVE THE GENTLE ##MEN A VERY GOOD DINNER
THIS SHE SAID WAS TRUE HO ##S ##P ##IT ##ALITY AND I AM NOT SURE THAT I DID NOT AG ##REE WITH HER
THEN THERE WERE THREE OR FOUR LEAD ##ING MEN OF THE COMM ##UN ##ITY WITH THEIR W ##IVES WHO WERE FOR THE MOST PART THE FATHER ##S AND MOTHER ##S OF THE YOUNG LAD ##IES
OH YES SAID J ##ACK AND I ' M NOW ##HERE
BUT I MEAN TO HAVE MY INN ##INGS BEFORE LONG
OF WHAT MISSUS NEVER ##BE ##ND HAD GONE THROUGH IN PROV ##ID ##ING BIRD ##S BE ##AST ##S AND FISH ##ES NOT TO TALK OF T ##ART ##S AND JE ##LL ##IES FOR THE DINNER OF THAT DAY NO ONE BUT MYSELF CAN HAVE ANY IDEA BUT IT MUST BE ADM ##ITTED THAT SHE ACCOM ##PL ##ISHED HER T ##ASK WITH TH ##OR ##OUGH SUCCESS
WE SAT WITH THE OFFIC ##ERS SOME LITTLE TIME AFTER DINNER AND THEN WENT AS ##H ##ORE
HOW MUCH OF EV ##IL OF REAL ACCOM ##PL ##ISHED EV ##IL HAD THERE NOT OCC ##UR ##RED TO ME DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS
WHAT COULD I DO NOW BUT JUST LAY MYSELF DOWN AND DIE
AND THE DEATH OF WHICH I DREAM ##T COULD NOT AL ##AS
WHEN THIS CAPTAIN SHOULD HAVE TAKEN HIMSELF AND HIS VE ##S ##SEL BACK TO ENGLAND I WOULD RET ##IRE TO A SMALL FAR ##M WHICH I POSS ##ESSED AT THE FAR ##TH ##EST SIDE OF THE ISLAND AND THERE IN SEC ##L ##USION WOULD I END MY DAYS
J ##ACK WOULD BECOME EV ##A ' S HAPPY HUSBAND AND WOULD REM ##AIN AM ##ID ##ST THE HUR ##RIED DUT ##IES OF THE E ##AGER WORLD
THINKING OF ALL THIS I WENT TO SLEEP
MISTER NEVER ##BE ##ND BEGAN THE CAPTAIN AND I OBSER ##VED THAT UP TO THAT MOMENT HE HAD GENERAL ##LY ADD ##RESSED ME AS PRES ##IDENT IT CANNOT BE DEN ##IED THAT WE HAVE COME HERE ON AN UN ##PLE ##AS ##ANT MISS ##ION
YOU HAVE RECEIVED US WITH ALL THAT COURT ##ES ##Y AND HO ##S ##P ##IT ##ALITY FOR WHICH YOUR CHARACTER IN ENGLAND STAND ##S SO HIGH
IT IS A DUT ##Y SAID I
BUT YOUR POWER IS SO SUPER ##IOR TO ANY THAT I CAN ADV ##ANCE AS TO MAKE US HERE FEEL THAT THERE IS NO DIS ##GR ##ACE IN Y ##IELD ##ING TO IT
NOT A DOUBT BUT HAD YOUR FORCE BEEN ONLY DOUB ##LE OR TRE ##BLE OUR OWN I SHOULD HAVE FOUND IT MY DUT ##Y TO STR ##UGG ##LE WITH YOU
THAT IS ALL QUITE TRUE MISTER NEVER ##BE ##ND SAID SIR FE ##R ##D ##IN ##AND ##O BROWN
I CAN AFF ##ORD TO SMILE BECAUSE I AM ABS ##OL ##UTE ##LY POWER ##LESS BEFORE YOU BUT I DO NOT THE LESS FEEL THAT IN A MATTER IN WHICH THE PRO ##GR ##ESS OF THE WORLD IS CONCER ##NED I OR RATHER WE HAVE BEEN PUT DOWN BY BR ##UTE FORCE
YOU HAVE COME TO US THR ##E ##ATE ##NING US WITH ABS ##OL ##UTE DEST ##RU ##CTION
THEREFORE I FEEL MYSELF QUITE ABLE AS PRES ##IDENT OF THIS REP ##UB ##LIC TO REC ##E ##IVE YOU WITH A COURT ##ES ##Y DU ##E TO THE SERV ##ANTS OF A FRIEND ##LY ALL ##Y
I CAN ASS ##URE YOU HE HAS NOT EVEN ALL ##OWED ME TO SEE THE TRI ##GG ##ER SINCE I HAVE BEEN ON BO ##ARD
THEN SAID SIR FE ##R ##D ##IN ##AND ##O THERE IS NOTHING FOR IT BUT THAT HE MUST TAKE YOU WITH HIM
THERE CAME UPON ME A SUDDEN SHO ##CK WHEN I HEARD THESE WORDS WHICH EXC ##EE ##DE ##D ANYTHING WHICH I HAD YET FELT
YOU HEAR WHAT SIR FE ##R ##D ##IN ##AND ##O BROWN HAS SAID REPLIED CAPTAIN BAT ##TLE ##A ##X
BUT WHAT IS THE DEL ##IC ##ATE MISS ##ION I ASKED
I WAS TO BE TAKEN AWAY AND CARRIED TO ENGLAND OR ELSE ##WHERE OR DRO ##WN ##ED UPON THE VO ##Y ##AGE IT MATTER ##ED NOT WHICH
THEN THE REP ##UB ##LIC OF BR ##IT ##AN ##N ##UL ##A WAS TO BE DECL ##ARED AS NO ##N EXIST ##ENT AND THE BR ##IT ##ISH FL ##AG WAS TO BE EX ##AL ##TED AND A BR ##IT ##ISH GOVERN ##OR INST ##ALL ##ED IN THE EX ##E ##C ##UT ##IVE CH ##AM ##BER ##S
