THERE ' S IR ##ON THEY SAY IN ALL OUR BLOOD AND A GRA ##IN OR TWO PERHAPS IS GOOD BUT HIS HE MAKES ME HAR ##SH ##LY FEEL HAS GOT A LITTLE TOO MUCH OF STE ##EL AN ##ON
MARGARET SAID MISTER HA ##LE AS HE RETURNED FROM SHOW ##ING HIS GU ##EST DOWN ##ST ##AIRS I COULD NOT HELP WATCH ##ING YOUR FACE WITH SOME ANX ##IET ##Y WHEN MISTER TH ##ORN ##TON MADE HIS CONF ##ESSION OF HAVING BEEN A SHO ##P BOY
YOU DON ' T MEAN THAT YOU THOUGHT ME SO SIL ##LY
I REALLY LIKE ##D THAT ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE HE SAID
HIS STATE ##MENT OF HAVING BEEN A SHO ##P BOY WAS THE THING I LIKE ##D BEST OF ALL
YOU WHO WERE ALWAYS ACC ##US ##ING PEOPLE OF BEING SHO ##PP ##Y AT HEL ##ST ##ONE
I DON ' T THINK MISTER HA ##LE YOU HAVE DONE QUITE RIGHT IN INT ##RO ##DU ##CING SUCH A PERSON TO US WITHOUT TELL ##ING US WHAT HE HAD BEEN
I REALLY WAS VERY MUCH AFRAID OF SHOW ##ING HIM HOW MUCH SHO ##CK ##ED I WAS AT SOME PART ##S OF WHAT HE SAID
HIS FATHER D ##YING IN MIS ##ER ##ABLE CIRCUMST ##ANCES
WHY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE WORK ##H ##OUSE
HIS FATHER SPE ##CUL ##ATED WILD ##LY FA ##ILED AND THEN K ##ILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE COULD NOT BEAR THE DIS ##GR ##ACE
ALL HIS FORM ##ER FRIENDS SH ##RU ##N ##K FROM THE DISC ##L ##OS ##URES THAT HAD TO BE MADE OF HIS DIS ##H ##ONES ##T G ##AM ##B ##LING WILD HOPE ##LESS STR ##UGG ##LES MADE WITH OTHER PEOPLE ' S MONEY TO REG ##AIN HIS OWN MO ##DER ##ATE PORT ##ION OF WE ##ALTH
NO ONE CAME FORWARD ##S TO HELP THE MOTHER AND THIS BOY
AT LEAST NO FRIEND CAME FORWARD ##S IMMEDIATELY AND MISSUS TH ##ORN ##TON IS NOT ONE I FAN ##CY TO WAIT TILL T ##ARD ##Y KIND ##NESS COMES TO FIND HER OUT
SO THEY LEFT MIL ##TON
HOW T ##AINT ##ED ASKED HER FATHER
OH PAP ##A BY THAT TE ##ST ##ING EVERYTHING BY THE STAND ##ARD OF WE ##ALTH
WHEN HE SPOKE OF THE ME ##CH ##AN ##ICAL POWER ##S HE EV ##IDENT ##LY LOOKED UPON THEM ONLY AS NEW WAY ##S OF EXT ##END ##ING TRA ##DE AND MAKING MONEY
AND THE POOR MEN AROUND HIM THEY WERE POOR BECAUSE THEY WERE VI ##CIOUS OUT OF THE PAL ##E OF HIS SY ##M ##P ##ATH ##IES BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT HIS IR ##ON NATURE AND THE CAP ##AB ##IL ##ITIES THAT IT GIVE ##S HIM FOR BEING RICH
NOT VI ##CIOUS HE NEVER SAID THAT
IMP ##RO ##V ##IDENT AND SELF IND ##UL ##GE ##N ##T WERE HIS WORDS
MARGARET WAS COLL ##ECT ##ING HER MOTHER ' S WORK ##ING MAT ##ER ##IAL ##S AND PREP ##ARING TO GO TO BED
JUST AS SHE WAS LEA ##VING THE ROOM SHE HE ##S ##IT ##ATED SHE WAS INCL ##INED TO MAKE AN AC ##K ##N ##OW ##LED ##G ##MENT WHICH SHE THOUGHT WOULD PLEASE HER FATHER BUT WHICH TO BE FULL AND TRUE MUST INCL ##UDE A LITTLE ANN ##OY ##ANCE
HOWEVER OUT IT CAME
PAP ##A I DO THINK MISTER TH ##ORN ##TON A VERY REMARK ##ABLE MAN BUT PERSON ##ALLY I DON ' T LIKE HIM AT ALL
AND I DO SAID HER FATHER LAUGH ##ING
PERSON ##ALLY AS YOU CALL IT AND ALL
I DON ' T SET HIM UP FOR A HER ##O OR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND
BUT GOOD NIGHT CHILD
THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER SIGN ##S OF SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT MISSUS HA ##LE
SHE AND D ##IX ##ON HELD MY ##STER ##IOUS CONS ##ULT ##ATIONS IN HER BED ##RO ##OM FROM WHICH D ##IX ##ON WOULD COME OUT CRY ##ING AND CROSS AS WAS HER C ##USTOM WHEN ANY DIST ##RESS OF HER MIST ##RESS CALLED UPON HER SY ##M ##P ##ATH ##Y
ONCE MARGARET HAD GONE INTO THE CH ##AM ##BER SOON AFTER D ##IX ##ON LEFT IT AND FOUND HER MOTHER ON HER KN ##EE ##S AND AS MARGARET STO ##LE OUT SHE CAUGHT A FEW WORDS WHICH WERE EV ##IDENT ##LY A PRAY ##ER FOR STRENGTH AND PAT ##IENCE TO END ##URE SEVER ##E BO ##D ##ILY SUFF ##ERING
BUT THOUGH SHE RECEIVED CARE ##S ##SE ##S AND FO ##ND WORDS BACK AGAIN IN SUCH PROF ##USION AS WOULD HAVE GLAD ##DEN ##ED HER FORM ##ER ##LY YET SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS A SECRET WITH ##H ##EL ##D FROM HER AND SHE BELIEVE ##D IT BO ##RE SER ##IOUS REF ##ERE ##N ##CE TO HER MOTHER ' S HEA ##LT ##H
SHE LAY AW ##AKE VERY LONG THIS NIGHT PLAN ##NING HOW TO LESS ##EN THE EV ##IL INFL ##UE ##N ##CE OF THEIR MIL ##TON LIFE ON HER MOTHER
A SERV ##ANT TO GIVE D ##IX ##ON PER ##MAN ##ENT ASS ##IST ##ANCE SHOULD BE GOT IF SHE GAVE UP HER WHOLE TIME TO THE SEA ##R ##CH AND THEN AT ANY RA ##TE HER MOTHER MIGHT HAVE ALL THE PERSON ##AL ATTENTION SHE REQU ##IRED AND HAD BEEN ACC ##USTOM ##ED TO HER WHOLE LIFE
VISIT ##ING REG ##ISTER OFFIC ##ES SEEING ALL MANNER OF UN ##L ##IKE ##LY PEOPLE AND VERY FEW IN THE LEAST LIKE ##LY ABS ##OR ##BED MARGARET ' S TIME AND THOUGHTS FOR SEVERAL DAYS
ONE AFTER ##N ##OON SHE MET BES ##S ##Y H ##IG ##GIN ##S IN THE STREET AND STOPPED TO SPEAK TO HER
WELL BES ##S ##Y HOW ARE YOU
BETTER AND NOT BETTER IF Y ##O KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS
NOT EXACT ##LY REPLIED MARGARET SM ##ILING
I ' M BETTER IN NOT BEING TO ##R ##N TO PIE ##CES BY CO ##UG ##HING O ' NIGHT ##S BUT I ' M WE ##ARY AND T ##IRED O MIL ##TON AND LONG ##ING TO GET AWAY TO THE LAND O BE ##UL ##AH AND WHEN I THINK I ' M FAR ##THER AND FAR ##THER OFF MY HEART S ##INK ##S AND I ' M NO BETTER I ' M WOR ##SE
MARGARET TURNED ROUND TO WALK ALONG ##SIDE OF THE GIRL IN HER FE ##E ##BLE PRO ##GR ##ESS HOME ##WARD
BUT FOR A MIN ##UTE OR TWO SHE DID NOT SPEAK
AT LAST SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE
BES ##S ##Y DO YOU WISH TO DIE
BES ##S ##Y WAS SIL ##ENT IN HER TURN FOR A MIN ##UTE OR TWO THEN SHE REPLIED
NO ##UGHT WOR ##SE THAN MANY OTHERS I REC ##K ##ON
BUT WHAT WAS IT
YOU KNOW I ' M A STRANGE ##R HERE SO PERHAPS I ' M NOT SO QUICK AT UNDERSTAND ##ING WHAT YOU MEAN AS IF I ' D LIVED ALL MY LIFE AT MIL ##TON
I HAD FORGOT ##TEN WHAT I SAID FOR THE TIME CONTINUED MARGARET QUIET ##LY
I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT AGAIN WHEN I WAS LESS BUS ##Y MAY I GO WITH YOU NOW
THE SHAR ##P ##NESS IN HER EYE TURNED TO A W ##IST ##FUL LONG ##ING AS SHE MET MARGARET ' S SOFT AND FRIEND ##LY G ##AZ ##E
AS THEY TURNED UP INTO A SMALL COURT OPEN ##ING OUT OF A SQU ##AL ##ID STREET BES ##S ##Y SAID
Y ##O ' LL NOT BE DA ##UNT ##ED IF FATHER ' S AT HOME AND SPEAK ##S A BIT GR ##UFF ##ISH AT FIRST
BUT N ##ICH ##OL ##AS WAS NOT AT HOME WHEN THEY ENTERED
G ##ASP ##ED BES ##S ##Y AT LAST
BES ##S ##Y TOOK A LONG AND FE ##VER ##ISH DRA ##UGHT AND THEN FELL BACK AND SH ##UT HER EYES
MARGARET BE ##N ##T OVER AND SAID BES ##S ##Y DON ' T BE IMP ##AT ##IENT WITH YOUR LIFE WHATEVER IT IS OR MAY HAVE BEEN
REMEMBER WHO GAVE IT YOU AND MADE IT WHAT IT IS
NOW I ' LL NOT HAVE MY WE ##N ##CH PRE ##ACH ##ED TO
BUT SURE ##LY SAID MARGARET FA ##CING ROUND YOU BELIEVE IN WHAT I SAID THAT GOD GAVE HER LIFE AND ORDER ##ED WHAT KIND OF LIFE IT WAS TO BE
I BELIEVE WHAT I SEE AND NO MORE
THAT ' S WHAT I BELIEVE YOUNG WOMAN
I DON ' T BELIEVE ALL I HEAR NO NOT BY A BIG DEAL
BUT HO ##O ' S COME AT LAST AND HO ##O ' S WE ##L ##CO ##ME AS LONG AS HO ##O ' LL KEEP FROM PRE ##ACH ##ING ON WHAT HO ##O KNOW ##S NO ##UGHT ABOUT
IT ' S SIM ##PLE AND NOT FAR TO FE ##T ##CH NOR HARD TO WORK
BUT THE GIRL ONLY PLE ##ADE ##D THE MORE WITH MARGARET
DON ' T THINK HARDLY ON HIM HE ' S A GOOD MAN HE IS
I SOMETIMES THINK I SHALL BE MO ##PE ##D W ##I SO ##R ##RO ##W EVEN IN THE CITY OF GOD IF FATHER IS NOT THERE
THE FE ##VER ##ISH COL ##OUR CAME INTO HER CHE ##E ##K AND THE FE ##VER ##ISH FL ##AME INTO HER EYE
BUT YOU WILL BE THERE FATHER YOU SHALL OH MY HEART
SHE PUT HER HAND TO IT AND BECAME G ##H ##AST ##LY PAL ##E
MARGARET HELD HER IN HER ARMS AND PUT THE WE ##ARY HEAD TO REST UPON HER BO ##SO ##M
PRESENT ##LY THE SP ##AS ##M THAT FORE ##SH ##AD ##OWED DEATH HAD PASSED AWAY AND BES ##S ##Y RO ##USED HERSELF AND SAID
I ' LL GO TO BED IT ' S BEST PLACE BUT CAT ##CHING AT MARGARET ' S GO ##WN Y ##O ' LL COME AGAIN I KNOW Y ##O WILL BUT JUST SAY IT
I WILL COME TO MOR ##RO ##W SAID MARGARET
MARGARET WENT AWAY VERY SAD AND THOUGHT ##FUL
SHE WAS LATE FOR TE ##A AT HOME
HAVE YOU MET WITH A SERV ##ANT DEAR
NO MA ##M ##MA THAT ANN ##E BU ##CK ##LEY WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE
SUPPOSE I TRY SAID MISTER HA ##LE
EVERY ##BODY ELSE HAS HAD THEIR TURN AT THIS GREAT DIFFIC ##ULT ##Y NOW LET ME TRY
I MAY BE THE C ##IND ##ERE ##LL ##A TO PUT ON THE SL ##IP ##PER AFTER ALL
WHAT WOULD YOU DO PAP ##A HOW WOULD YOU SET ABOUT IT
WHY I WOULD APP ##LY TO SOME GOOD HOUSE MOTHER TO RECO ##M ##MEN ##D ME ONE KNOWN TO HERSELF OR HER SERV ##ANTS
VERY GOOD BUT WE MUST FIRST CAT ##CH OUR HOUSE MOTHER
THE MOTHER OF WHOM HE SPOKE TO US SAID MARGARET
MISSUS TH ##ORN ##TON THE ONLY MOTHER HE HAS I BELIEVE SAID MISTER HA ##LE QUIET ##LY

PERHAPS SHE MAY HAVE A REL ##ATION WHO MIGHT SU ##IT US AND BE GLAD OF OUR PLACE
SHE SOUND ##ED TO BE SUCH A CARE ##FUL E ##CO ##N ##OM ##ICAL PERSON THAT I SHOULD LIKE ANY ONE OUT OF THE SAME FAMILY
MY DEAR SAID MISTER HA ##LE AL ##AR ##MED PRAY DON ' T GO OFF ON THAT IDEA
I AM SURE AT ANY RA ##TE SHE WOULD NOT LIKE STRANGE ##R ##S TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT
TAKE NOT ##ICE THAT IS NOT MY KIND OF HA ##UGHT ##INESS PAP ##A IF I HAVE ANY AT ALL WHICH I DON ' T AG ##REE TO THOUGH YOU ' RE ALWAYS ACC ##US ##ING ME OF IT
I DON ' T KNOW PO ##S ##IT ##IVE ##LY THAT IT IS HER ##S EITHER BUT FROM LITTLE THINGS I HAVE GATHER ##ED FROM HIM I FAN ##CY SO

WELL THEY COULD BE WOR ##SE OFF
OLD PE ##TER HAD FRIENDS AND THEY A ##IN ' T GOING TO LET THEM COME TO NO HAR ##M
BLA ##MED IF HE DIDN ' T INQU ##IRE ABOUT EVERY ##BODY AND EVERYTHING IN THAT BL ##ESSED TOWN AND ALL ABOUT THE W ##IL ##KS ##ES AND ABOUT PE ##TER ' S BUSINESS ##WH ##ICH WAS A T ##AN ##NER AND ABOUT GE ##OR ##GE ' SW ##H ##ICH WAS A CAR ##PE ##N ##TER AND ABOUT HAR ##VE ##Y ' SW ##H ##ICH WAS A DIS ##SE ##N ##TER ##ING MIN ##ISTER AND SO ON AND SO ON THEN HE SAYS

WHEN WE STRUCK THE BOAT SHE WAS ABOUT DONE LO ##AD ##ING AND PRETTY SOON SHE GOT OFF
NOW HUS ##TLE BACK RIGHT OFF AND FE ##T ##CH THE DU ##KE UP HERE AND THE NEW CAR ##PE ##T B ##AG ##S
SO THEN THEY WAIT ##ED FOR A STE ##AM ##BO ##AT
BUT THE KING WAS CA ' M HE SAYS
THEY GIVE A GL ##ANCE AT ONE ANOTHER AND NO ##D ##DE ##D THEIR HEAD ##S AS MUCH AS TO SAY WHAT D I TELL YOU
THEN ONE OF THEM SAYS KIND OF SOFT AND GENTLE
PH ##EL ##PS WAS ONE OF THESE LITTLE ONE HORSE CO ##T ##TON PLAN ##T ##ATIONS AND THEY ALL LOOK AL ##IKE
I WENT AROUND AND CL ##UMB OVER THE BACK ST ##ILE BY THE AS ##H HOP ##PER AND START ##ED FOR THE K ##ITCH ##EN
I OUT WITH A YES ' M BEFORE I THOUGHT
SO THEN SHE START ##ED FOR THE HOUSE LEAD ##ING ME BY THE HAND AND THE CHILDREN T ##AG ##GING AFTER
WHEN WE GOT THERE SHE SET ME DOWN IN A SP ##L ##IT BO ##T ##TO ##MED CHAIR AND SET HERSELF DOWN ON A LITTLE LOW STO ##OL IN FRONT OF ME HOLD ##ING BOTH OF MY HANDS AND SAYS
WELL IT ' S LU ##CK ##Y BECAUSE SOMETIMES PEOPLE DO GET HUR ##T
AND I THINK HE DIED AFTER ##WARDS HE WAS A B ##AP ##T ##IST
YES IT WAS MOR ##T ##IFIC ##ATION ##TH ##AT WAS IT
YOUR UNCLE ' S BEEN UP TO THE TOWN EVERY DAY TO FE ##T ##CH YOU
YOU MUST A MET HIM ON THE ROAD DIDN ' T YOU OLD ##ISH MAN WITH A
WHY CHILD IT LL BE STO ##LE
IT WAS KIND ##ER TH ##IN I ##CE BUT I SAYS
I HAD MY MIND ON THE CHILDREN ALL THE TIME I WANTED TO GET THEM OUT TO ONE SIDE AND P ##UMP THEM A LITTLE AND FIND OUT WHO I WAS
PRETTY SOON SHE MADE THE COLD CH ##ILL ##S STRE ##AK ALL DOWN MY BACK BECAUSE SHE SAYS
I SEE IT WAR ##N ' T A BIT OF USE TO TRY TO GO AH ##EAD I ' D GOT TO THR ##OW UP MY HAND
SO I SAYS TO MYSELF HERE ' S ANOTHER PLACE WHERE I GOT TO RES ##K THE TRUTH
I OPENED MY MOUTH TO BEGIN BUT SHE GRA ##B ##BED ME AND HUS ##TLE ##D ME IN BEHIND THE BED AND SAYS HERE HE COMES
CHILDREN DON ' T YOU SAY A WORD
I SEE I WAS IN A FIX NOW
MISSUS PH ##EL ##PS SHE J ##UMP ##S FOR HIM AND SAYS
HAS HE COME NO SAYS HER HUSBAND
I CAN ' T IMAG ##INE SAYS THE OLD GENTLEMAN AND I MUST SAY IT MAKES ME DR ##EAD ##FUL UN ##E ##AS ##Y
UN ##E ##AS ##Y SHE SAYS I ' M READY TO GO DIST ##RA ##CTED
HE MUST A COME AND YOU ' VE MISS ##ED HIM ALONG THE ROAD
OH DON ' T DIST ##RESS ME ANY MORE ' N I ' M ALREADY DIST ##RESSED
WHY SIL ##AS LOOK Y ##OND ##ER UP THE ROAD A ##IN ' T THAT SOME ##BODY COMING
THE OLD GENTLEMAN ST ##ARED AND SAYS
I HA ##IN ' T NO IDEA WHO IS IT
IT ' S TOM SAW ##Y ##ER
BEING TOM SAW ##Y ##ER WAS EAS ##Y AND COMFORT ##ABLE AND IT STAY ##ED EAS ##Y AND COMFORT ##ABLE TILL BY AND BY I HEAR A STE ##AM ##BO ##AT CO ##UG ##HING ALONG DOWN THE RIVER
THEN I SAYS TO MYSELF S ' PO ##SE TOM SAW ##Y ##ER COMES DOWN ON THAT BOAT
BUT I AM H ##UG ##EL ##Y PLEASE ##D THAT YOU HAVE SEEN MY LADY
I KNEW YOU COULD NOT CH ##OOSE BUT LIKE HER BUT YET LET ME TELL YOU YOU HAVE SEEN BUT THE WOR ##ST OF HER
HER CONVERS ##ATION HAS MORE CHAR ##MS THAN CAN BE IN MERE BEAUTY AND HER HUM ##OUR AND DISP ##OSITION WOULD MAKE A DEF ##ORM ##ED PERSON APPEAR LOVE ##LY
WHY DID YOU NOT SEND ME THAT NEWS AND A G ##AR ##LAND
WELL THE BEST ON ' T IS I HAVE A SQU ##IRE NOW THAT IS AS GOOD AS A KNIGHT
IN EAR ##NE ##ST WE HAVE HAD SUCH A SK ##IR ##M ##ISH AND UPON SO FOOL ##ISH AN OCCASION AS I CANNOT TELL WHICH IS STRANGE ##ST
ALL THE PEOPLE THAT I HAD EVER IN MY LIFE REF ##USED WERE BROUGHT AGAIN UPON THE ST ##AGE LIKE RICH ##ARD THE THREE S G ##H ##OST ##S TO REP ##RO ##ACH ME WITH ##AL AND ALL THE KIND ##NESS HIS DISCOVER ##IES COULD MAKE I HAD FOR YOU WAS LAID TO MY CHAR ##GE
MY BEST QU ##AL ##ITIES IF I HAVE ANY THAT ARE GOOD SERV ##ED BUT FOR AG ##GR ##AV ##ATIONS OF MY FA ##ULT AND I WAS ALL ##OWED TO HAVE W ##IT AND UNDERSTAND ##ING AND DISC ##RET ##ION IN OTHER THINGS THAT IT MIGHT APPEAR I HAD NONE IN THIS
T ##IS A STRANGE CHANGE AND I AM VERY SO ##R ##RY FOR IT BUT I ' LL SWE ##AR I KNOW NOT HOW TO HELP IT
MISTER FISH IS THE SQU ##IRE OF DA ##ME ##S AND HAS SO MANY MIST ##RESS ##ES THAT ANY ##BODY MAY PRET ##END A SHAR ##E IN HIM AND BE BELIEVE ##D BUT THOUGH I HAVE THE HON ##OUR TO BE HIS NEAR NEIGHB ##OUR TO SPEAK FREE ##LY I CANNOT BRA ##G MUCH THAT HE MAKES ANY COURT TO ME AND I KNOW NO YOUNG WOMAN IN THE COUNTRY THAT HE DOES NOT VISIT OFTEN
I THINK MY YOUNG ##EST BROTHER COMES DOWN WITH HIM
I CAN NO SOON ##ER GIVE YOU SOME LITTLE H ##INT ##S WHERE ##AB ##OUT ##S THEY LIVE BUT YOU KNOW THEM PRESENT ##LY AND I MEANT YOU SHOULD BE BEH ##OLD ##ING TO ME FOR YOUR ACQU ##AINT ##ANCE
BUT IT SEEMS THIS GENTLEMAN IS NOT SO EAS ##Y ACC ##ESS BUT YOU MAY AC ##K ##N ##OW ##LEDGE SOMETHING DU ##E TO ME IF I INCL ##INE HIM TO LOOK GRA ##CIOUS ##LY UPON YOU AND THEREFORE THERE IS NOT MUCH HAR ##M DONE
I HAVE MISS ##ED FOUR F ##ITS AND HAD BUT FIVE AND HAVE RECO ##VER ##ED SO MUCH STRENGTH AS MADE ME VE ##N ##T ##URE TO MEET YOUR LETTER ON WE ##D ##NE ##S ##DAY A MIL ##E FROM HOME
BUT BESIDES I CAN GIVE YOU OTHERS
I AM HERE MUCH MORE OUT OF PEOPLE ' S WAY THAN IN TOWN WHERE MY AUNT AND SUCH AS PRET ##END AN INTEREST IN ME AND A POWER OVER ME DO SO PERS ##E ##C ##UTE ME WITH THEIR GOOD NATURE AND TAKE IT SO ILL THAT THEY ARE NOT ACCEPT ##ED AS I WOULD LIVE IN A HO ##LLOW TREE TO AV ##O ##ID THEM
YOU WILL THINK HIM AL ##TERED AND IF IT BE POSSIBLE MORE ME ##LA ##N ##CH ##OL ##Y THAN HE WAS
IF MAR ##RIAGE AG ##REE ##S NO BETTER WITH OTHER PEOPLE THAN IT DOES WITH HIM I SHALL PRAY THAT ALL MY FRIENDS MAY SC ##APE IT
WELL IN EAR ##NE ##ST IF I WERE A PRINCE THAT LADY SHOULD BE MY MIST ##RESS BUT I CAN GIVE NO RU ##LE TO ANY ONE ELSE AND PERHAPS THOSE THAT ARE IN NO DANGER OF LO ##S ##ING THEIR HEART ##S TO HER MAY BE INF ##IN ##ITE ##LY TAKEN WITH ONE I SHOULD NOT VAL ##UE AT ALL FOR SO SAYS THE JUST ##IN ##IAN W ##ISE PROV ##IDENCE HAS ORD ##AINED IT THAT BY THEIR DIFFERENT HUM ##OUR ##S EVERY ##BODY MIGHT FIND SOMETHING TO PLEASE THEMSELVES WITH ##AL WITHOUT EN ##V ##YING THEIR NEIGHB ##OUR ##S
THE MATTER IS NOT GREAT FOR I CONF ##ESS I DO NATURAL ##LY HAT ##E THE NO ##ISE AND TALK OF THE WORLD AND SHOULD BE BEST PLEASE ##D NEVER TO BE KNOWN IN ' T UPON ANY OCCASION WHAT ##SO ##EVER YET SINCE IT CAN NEVER BE WHO ##LLY AV ##O ##IDED ONE MUST SATISF ##Y ONE ##SELF BY DOING NOTHING THAT ONE NEED CARE WHO KNOW ##S
IF I HAD A PICT ##URE THAT WERE F ##IT FOR YOU YOU SHOULD HAVE IT
HOW CAN YOU TALK OF DEF ##YING FORT ##UNE NO ##BODY LIVE ##S WITHOUT IT AND THEREFORE WHY SHOULD YOU IMAG ##INE YOU COULD
I KNOW NOT HOW MY BROTHER COMES TO BE SO WELL INFORM ##ED AS YOU SAY BUT I AM CERTAIN HE KNOW ##S THE UT ##MOST OF THE IN ##J ##UR ##IES YOU HAVE RECEIVED FROM HER
WE HAVE HAD ANOTHER DE ##B ##ATE BUT MUCH MORE CAL ##M ##LY
AND BESIDES THERE WAS A TIME WHEN WE OUR ##SELVES WERE IND ##IFF ##ERE ##N ##T TO ONE ANOTHER DID I DO SO THEN OR HAVE I LEAR ##NED IT SINCE
I HAVE BEEN STUD ##YING HOW TOM CHE ##E ##KE MIGHT COME BY HIS INTELL ##IG ##ENCE AND I VER ##ILY BELIEVE HE HAS IT FROM MY CO ##US ##IN PE ##TERS
HOW KIND ##LY DO I TAKE THESE C ##IV ##IL ##ITIES OF YOUR FATHER ' S IN EAR ##NE ##ST YOU CANNOT IMAG ##INE HOW HIS LETTER PLEASE ##D ME
WOULD IT WOULD LEAVE ME AND THEN I COULD BELIEVE I SHALL NOT ALWAYS HAVE OCCASION FOR IT
MY POOR LADY V ##AV ##AS ##OUR IS CARRIED TO THE TO ##W ##ER AND HER GREAT BELL ##Y COULD NOT EXC ##USE HER BECAUSE SHE WAS ACQU ##AINT ##ED BY SOME ##BODY THAT THERE WAS A PL ##OT AGAINST THE PROT ##ECT ##OR AND DID NOT DISCOVER IT
SHE HAS TOLD NOW ALL THAT WAS TOLD HER BUT VO ##W ##S SHE WILL NEVER SAY FROM WHEN ##CE SHE HAD IT WE SHALL SEE WHETHER HER RESOL ##UTION ##S ARE AS UN ##AL ##TER ##ABLE AS THOSE OF MY LADY T ##AL ##MA ##SH
I WONDER HOW SHE BEH ##AVE ##D HERSELF WHEN SHE WAS MAR ##RIED
I NEVER SAW ANY ONE YET THAT DID NOT LOOK SIM ##PLY AND OUT OF COUNT ##EN ##ANCE NOR EVER KNEW A WE ##D ##D ##ING WELL DES ##IGN ##ED BUT ONE AND THAT WAS OF TWO PERSON ##S WHO HAD TIME ENOUGH I CONF ##ESS TO CONTR ##IVE IT AND NO ##BODY TO PLEASE IN ' T BUT THEMSELVES
THE TRUTH IS I COULD NOT END ##URE TO BE MISSUS BR ##IDE IN A PUBLIC WE ##D ##D ##ING TO BE MADE THE HAPP ##IEST PERSON ON EARTH
DO NOT TAKE IT ILL FOR I WOULD END ##URE IT IF I COULD RATHER THAN FA ##IL BUT IN EAR ##NE ##ST I DO NOT THINK IT WERE POSSIBLE FOR ME
YET IN EAR ##NE ##ST YOUR FATHER WILL NOT FIND MY BROTHER PE ##Y ##TON WANT ##ING IN C ##IV ##ILITY THOUGH HE IS NOT A MAN OF MUCH COMP ##L ##IMENT UN ##LESS IT BE IN HIS LETTER ##S TO ME NOR AN UN ##RE ##ASON ##ABLE PERSON IN ANYTHING SO HE WILL ALL ##OW HIM OUT OF HIS KIND ##NESS TO HIS WIFE TO SET A HIGH ##ER VAL ##UE UPON HER SISTER THAN SHE DES ##ER ##VES
MY AUNT TOLD ME NO LONGER AGO ##NE THAN YES ##TER ##DAY THAT I WAS THE MOST W ##IL ##FUL WOMAN THAT EVER SHE KNEW AND HAD AN OBS ##T ##IN ##AC ##Y OF SPIRIT NOTHING COULD OVER ##CO ##ME TAKE HE ##ED
YOU SEE I GIVE YOU FAIR WAR ##NING
BY THE NEXT I SHALL BE GONE INTO KE ##N ##T AND MY OTHER JOUR ##NEY IS LAID AS ##IDE WHICH I AM NOT DISP ##LE ##ASED AT BECAUSE IT WOULD HAVE BR ##OKEN OUR INTER ##CO ##UR ##SE VERY MUCH
HERE ARE SOME VER ##SE ##S OF CO ##W ##LEY ' S TELL ME HOW YOU LIKE THEM
I TOLD YOU IN MY LAST THAT MY SUFF ##OL ##K JOUR ##NEY WAS LAID AS ##IDE AND THAT INTO KE ##N ##T HAST ##ENED
IF I DRO ##WN BY THE WAY THIS WILL BE MY LAST LETTER AND LIKE A WILL I BE ##QU ##E ##ATH ALL MY KIND ##NESS TO YOU IN IT WITH A CHAR ##GE NEVER TO BEST ##OW IT ALL UPON ANOTHER MIST ##RESS LE ##ST MY G ##H ##OST R ##ISE AGAIN AND HA ##UNT YOU
INDEED I LIKE HIM EXT ##RE ##ME ##LY AND HE IS COMM ##END ##ED TO ME BY PEOPLE THAT KNOW HIM VERY WELL AND ARE ABLE TO JUD ##GE FOR A MOST EXC ##ELL ##ENT SERV ##ANT AND FAITH ##FUL AS POSSIBLE
BECAUSE YOU FIND FA ##ULT WITH MY OTHER LETTER ##S THIS IS LIKE TO BE SHORT ##ER THAN THEY I DID NOT INT ##END IT SO THOUGH I CAN ASS ##URE YOU
I DO NOT FIND IT THOUGH I AM TOLD I WAS SO EXT ##RE ##ME ##LY WHEN I BELIEVE ##D YOU LOVED ME
BUT I AM CALLED UPON
DIRECT ##ED FOR YOUR MASTER
I SEE YOU CAN CH ##IDE WHEN YOU PLEASE AND WITH AUTHOR ##ITY BUT I DES ##ER ##VE IT I CONF ##ESS AND ALL I CAN SAY FOR MYSELF IS THAT MY FA ##ULT PRO ##CEED ##ED FROM A VERY GOOD PRINCI ##PLE IN ME
WE DA ##RE NOT LET OUR TO ##NG ##UES LIE MORE ON ONE SIDE OF OUR MOUTH ##S THAN T ' OTHER FOR FEAR OF OVER ##T ##URN ##ING IT
YOU ARE SATISF ##IED I HOPE ER ##E THIS THAT I SC ##APE ##D DRO ##WN ##ING
BUT I AM TROUBLE ##D MUCH YOU SHOULD MAKE SO ILL A JOUR ##NEY TO SO LITTLE PURPOSE INDEED I WR ##IT BY THE FIRST POST AFTER MY ARRI ##VAL HERE AND CANNOT IMAG ##INE HOW YOU CAME TO MISS OF MY LETTER ##S
HOW WE ##L ##CO ##ME YOU WILL BE BUT AL ##AS
FOR MY LIFE I CANNOT BE ##AT INTO THEIR HEAD ##S A PASS ##ION THAT MUST BE SUBJECT TO NO DEC ##AY AN EVEN PERFECT KIND ##NESS THAT MUST LAST PER ##PE ##T ##UALLY WITHOUT THE LEAST INTER ##M ##ISS ##ION
THEY LAUGH TO HEAR ME SAY THAT ONE UN ##K ##IND WORD WOULD DEST ##RO ##Y ALL THE SATISF ##ACT ##ION OF MY LIFE AND THAT I SHOULD EXPECT OUR KIND ##NESS SHOULD INC ##RE ##ASE EVERY DAY IF IT WERE POSSIBLE BUT NEVER LESS ##EN
WE GO AB ##RO ##AD ALL DAY AND PLAY ALL NIGHT AND SAY OUR PRAY ##ERS WHEN WE HAVE TIME
WELL IN SO ##BER EAR ##NE ##ST NOW I WOULD NOT LIVE THUS A TW ##ELVE ##M ##ONT ##H TO G ##AIN ALL THAT THE KING HAS LOST UN ##LESS IT WERE TO GIVE IT HIM AGAIN
WILL YOU BE SO GOOD NATURE ##D
HE HAS ONE SON AND T ##IS THE FINE ##ST BOY THAT E ' ER YOU SAW AND HAS A NO ##BLE SPIRIT BUT YET STAND ##S IN THAT AW ##E OF HIS FATHER THAT ONE WORD FROM HIM IS AS MUCH AS TWENTY WH ##IP ##P ##INGS
YOU MUST GIVE ME LEAVE TO ENTER ##TAIN YOU THUS WITH DISC ##OUR ##SE ##S OF THE FAMILY FOR I CAN TELL YOU NOTHING ELSE FROM HEN ##CE
NOT TO KNOW WHEN YOU WOULD COME HOME I CAN ASS ##URE YOU NOR FOR ANY OTHER OCCASION OF MY OWN BUT WITH A CO ##US ##IN OF MINE THAT HAD LONG DES ##IGN ##ED TO MAKE HERSELF SP ##ORT WITH HIM AND DID NOT MISS OF HER A ##IM
IN MY LIFE I NEVER HEARD SO RID ##IC ##UL ##OUS A DISC ##OUR ##SE AS HE MADE US AND NO OLD WOMAN WHO PASS ##ES FOR A W ##ITCH COULD HAVE BEEN MORE P ##U ##Z ##Z ##LED TO SEE ##K WHAT TO SAY TO REASON ##ABLE PEOPLE THAN HE WAS
EVER SINCE THIS ADV ##ENT ##URE I HAVE HAD SO GREAT A BELIE ##F IN ALL THINGS OF THIS NATURE THAT I COULD NOT FOR ##BE ##AR LAY ##ING A PE ##AS CO ##D WITH N ##INE PE ##AS IN ' T UNDER MY DOOR YES ##TER ##DAY AND WAS INFORM ##ED BY IT THAT MY HUSBAND ' S NAME SHOULD BE TH ##OM ##AS HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT
SHE PULL ##ED HER HAIR DOWN TURNED HER SK ##IRT BACK PUT HER FEET ON THE FE ##NDER AND TOOK PUT ##TE ##L INTO HER LA ##P ALL OF WHICH ARR ##ANGE ##MENTS SIGN ##IFIED THAT SOMETHING VERY IMPORT ##ANT HAD GOT TO BE THOUGHT OVER AND SET ##TLE ##D
THE MORE PROP ##OS ##ALS THE MORE CRE ##D ##IT
I VE TRIED IT AND LIKE ##D IT AND MAY ##BE THIS IS THE CONSE ##QU ##ENCE OF THAT NIGHT ' S F ##UN
JUST SUPPOSE IT IS TRUE THAT HE DOES ASK ME AND I SAY YES
WHAT A SP ##ITE ##FUL THING I AM
I COULD DO SO MUCH FOR ALL AT HOME HOW I SHOULD ENJ ##OY THAT
LET ME SEE HOW CAN I BEGIN
HE HAS KNOWN HER ALL HER LIFE AND HAS A GOOD INFL ##UE ##N ##CE OVER HER
NOW AS POL ##LY WAS BY NO MEANS A PERFECT CREAT ##URE I AM FREE TO CONF ##ESS THAT THE OLD TEM ##PT ##ATION ASS ##AIL ##ED HER MORE THAN ONCE THAT WEE ##K FOR WHEN THE FIRST EXC ##ITE ##MENT OF THE DO ##D ##GING REF ##ORM HAD SUB ##SIDE ##D SHE MISS ##ED THE PLEAS ##ANT LITTLE INTER ##V ##IEW ##S THAT USED TO PUT A CERTAIN FL ##AV ##OR OF ROM ##ANCE INTO HER DU ##LL HARD WORK ##ING DAYS
I DON ' T THINK IT WAS HIS WE ##ALTH ACCOM ##PL ##ISH ##MENTS OR POSITION THAT MOST ATT ##RA ##CTED POL ##LY THOUGH THESE DOUBT ##LESS POSS ##ESSED A GREAT ##ER INFL ##UE ##N ##CE THAN SHE SUS ##PECT ##ED
IT WAS THAT INDE ##S ##CRIB ##ABLE SOMETHING WHICH WOMEN ARE QUICK TO SEE AND FEEL IN MEN WHO HAVE BEEN BL ##ESSED WITH W ##ISE AND GOOD MOTHER ##S
THIS HAD AN ES ##PE ##CI ##AL CHAR ##M TO POL ##LY FOR SHE SOON FOUND THAT THIS SIDE OF HIS CHARACTER WAS NOT SHOW ##N TO EVERY ONE
LATE ##LY THIS HAD CHANGE ##D ES ##PE ##CI ##ALLY TOWARDS POL ##LY AND IT FL ##ATTER ##ED HER MORE THAN SHE WOULD CONF ##ESS EVEN TO HERSELF
AT FIRST SHE TRIED TO THINK SHE COULD BUT UN ##FORT ##UN ##ATELY HEART ##S ARE SO CONTR ##ARY THAT THEY WON ' T BE OB ##ED ##IENT TO REASON WILL OR EVEN GRA ##T ##ITUDE
POL ##LY FELT A VERY COR ##D ##IAL FRIENDS ##H ##IP FOR MISTER SY ##D ##NEY BUT NOT ONE PARTIC ##LE OF THE LOVE WHICH IS THE ONLY CO ##IN IN WHICH LOVE CAN BE TR ##UL ##Y PA ##ID
THIS FIN ##ISHED POL ##LY ' S INDE ##CI ##S ##ION AND AFTER THAT NIGHT SHE NEVER ALL ##OWED HERSELF TO D ##W ##ELL UPON THE PLEAS ##ANT TEM ##PT ##ATION WHICH CAME IN A GU ##ISE PARTICULAR ##LY ATT ##RA ##CT ##IVE TO A YOUNG GIRL WITH A SP ##ICE OF THE OLD EV ##E IN HER COMP ##OSITION
WHEN SAT ##UR ##DAY CAME POL ##LY START ##ED AS US ##UAL FOR A VISIT TO BEC ##K ##Y AND BES ##S BUT COULD N ' T RES ##IST STO ##PPING AT THE SH ##AW ##S TO LEAVE A LITTLE PAR ##CE ##L FOR FAN THOUGH IT WAS CALL ##ING TIME
A FOOL ##ISH LITTLE SPE ##E ##CH TO MAKE TO A DOG BUT YOU SEE POL ##LY WAS ONLY A TEN ##DER HEART ##ED GIRL TRY ##ING TO DO HER DUT ##Y
TAKE HOLD OF MASTER CHAR ##LEY ' S HAND MISS MA ##M ##IE AND WALK PRETTY LIKE WILL ##Y AND FLO ##S ##S ##Y SAID THE MAID
AT A STREET CORN ##ER A BLACK EYE ##D SCHOOL BOY WAS PART ##ING FROM A RO ##S ##Y FACE ##D SCHOOL GIRL WHOSE MUS ##IC RO ##LL HE WAS REL ##UCT ##ANTLY SUR ##REN ##DER ##ING
HOW HE GOT THERE WAS NEVER VERY CLEAR TO POL ##LY BUT THERE HE WAS FL ##USHED AND A LITTLE OUT OF BREATH BUT LOOKING SO GLAD TO SEE HER THAT SHE HAD N ' T THE HEART TO BE ST ##IFF AND CO ##OL AS SHE HAD FULL ##Y INT ##END ##ED TO BE WHEN THEY MET
SHE REALLY COULD N ' T HELP IT IT WAS SO PLEAS ##ANT TO SEE HIM AGAIN JUST WHEN SHE WAS FEELING SO LO ##NE ##LY
THAT IS THE WAY I GET TO THE RO ##TH ##S ANSWERED POL ##LY
SHE DID NOT MEAN TO TELL BUT HIS FR ##ANK ##NESS WAS SO AG ##REE ##ABLE SHE FORGOT HERSELF
BUT I KNOW HER BETTER AND I ASS ##URE YOU THAT SHE DOES IMP ##RO ##VE SHE TRI ##ES TO MEN ##D HER FA ##ULT ##S THOUGH SHE WON ' T OWN IT AND WILL SURPR ##ISE YOU SOME DAY BY THE AM ##OUNT OF HEART AND SENSE AND GOOD ##NESS SHE HAS GOT
THAN ##K YOU NO
HOW LOVE ##LY THE PAR ##K LOOK ##S SHE SAID IN GREAT CONF ##USION
ASKED THE ART ##FUL YOUNG MAN LAY ##ING A TRA ##P INTO WHICH POL ##LY IMMEDIATELY FELL
HE WAS QUICK ##ER TO TAKE A H ##INT THAN SHE HAD EXPECT ##ED AND BEING BOTH PRO ##UD AND GENER ##OUS RESOL ##VED TO SET ##TLE THE MATTER AT ONCE FOR POL ##LY ' S SA ##KE AS WELL AS HIS OWN
SO WHEN SHE MADE HER LAST BR ##ILL ##IAN ##T REMARK HE SAID QUIET ##LY WATCH ##ING HER FACE KE ##EN ##LY ALL THE WHILE I THOUGHT SO WELL I M GOING OUT OF TOWN ON BUSINESS FOR SEVERAL WEE ##KS SO YOU CAN ENJ ##OY YOUR LITTLE BIT OF COUNTRY WITHOUT BEING ANN ##OY ##ED BY ME ANN ##OY ##ED
SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF THE CO ##QU ##ET ##TE IN HER AND I VE NO DOUBT THAT WITH TIME AND TRA ##INING SHE WOULD HAVE BECOME A VERY DANGER ##OUS LITTLE PERSON BUT NOW SHE WAS FAR TOO TRANS ##PAR ##ENT AND STRAIGHT ##F ##OR ##WARD BY NATURE EVEN TO TELL A WHITE LIE CLE ##VER ##LY
HE WAS GONE BEFORE SHE COULD DO ANYTHING BUT LOOK UP AT HIM WITH A REM ##ORS ##E ##FUL FACE AND SHE WALKED ON FEELING THAT THE FIRST AND PERHAPS THE ONLY LOVE ##R SHE WOULD EVER HAVE HAD READ HIS ANSWER AND ACCEPT ##ED IT IN SILENCE
POL ##LY DID NOT RETURN TO HER FAV ##OR ##ITE WALK TILL SHE LEAR ##NED FROM MIN ##N ##IE THAT UNCLE HAD REALLY LEFT TOWN AND THEN SHE FOUND THAT HIS FRIEND ##LY COMPANY AND CONVERS ##ATION WAS WHAT HAD MADE THE WAY SO PLEAS ##ANT AFTER ALL
WA ##GG ##ING TO AND FR ##O AS US ##UAL WHAT ' S THE NEWS WITH YOU
PERHAPS SHE LL J ##ILT HIM
UT ##TER ##LY DONE WITH AND LAID UPON THE SHE ##LF
MIN ##N ##IE SAID THE OTHER DAY SHE WISH ##ED SHE WAS A P ##IG ##E ##ON SO SHE COULD PA ##D ##DLE IN THE P ##UD ##DLE ##S AND NOT F ##USS ABOUT RU ##B ##BER ##S
NOW DON ' T BE AFF ##ECT ##ED POL ##LY BUT JUST TELL ME LIKE A DEAR HAS N ' T HE PROP ##OSED
DON ' T YOU THINK HE MEANS TO
TR ##UL ##Y TR ##UL ##Y FAN
I DON ' T MEAN TO BE PR ##YING BUT I REALLY THOUGHT HE DID
WELL I ALWAYS MEANT TO TRY IT IF I GOT A CHANCE AND I HAVE
I JUST GAVE HIM A H ##INT AND HE TOOK IT
HE MEANT TO GO AWAY BEFORE THAT SO DON ' T THINK HIS HEART IS BR ##OKEN OR MIND WHAT SIL ##LY T ##AT ##TLE ##R ##S SAY
HE UNDERST ##OOD AND BEING A GENTLEMAN MADE NO F ##USS
BUT POL ##LY IT WOULD HAVE BEEN A GRAND THING FOR YOU
I M O ##D ##D YOU KNOW AND PRE ##FE ##R TO BE AN INDE ##PEND ##ENT SP ##INS ##TER AND TE ##ACH MUS ##IC ALL MY DAYS
NEVER MIND WHAT THE BUSINESS WAS IT SUFF ##ICES TO SAY THAT IT WAS A GOOD BEGIN ##NING FOR A YOUNG MAN LIKE TOM WHO HAVING BEEN BORN AND BRE ##D IN THE MOST CONSE ##R ##V ##ATIVE CLASS OF THE MOST CON ##CEI ##TED CITY IN NEW ENGLAND NEED ##ED JUST THE HEA ##LT ##H ##Y HEART ##Y SOCI ##AL INFL ##UE ##N ##CES OF THE WE ##ST TO W ##IDE ##N HIS VIEW ##S AND MAKE A MAN OF HIM
FORT ##UN ##ATELY EVERY ONE WAS SO BUS ##Y WITH THE NECESSARY PREP ##AR ##ATIONS THAT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR ROM ##ANCE OF ANY SORT AND THE FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE WORK ##ED TOGETHER AS SO ##BER ##LY AND SENS ##IB ##LY AS IF ALL SORT ##S OF EM ##OT ##IONS WERE NOT BO ##T ##TLE ##D UP IN THEIR RESPECT ##IVE HEART ##S
P ##ITY THAT THE END SHOULD COME SO SOON BUT THE HOUR DID ITS WORK AND WENT ITS WAY LEA ##VING A CLEAR ##ER AT ##M ##OS ##PH ##ERE BEHIND THOUGH THE YOUNG FO ##L ##KS DID NOT SEE IT THEN FOR THEIR EYES WERE D ##IM BECAUSE OF THE PART ##INGS THAT MUST BE
IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR TWO THINGS I FEAR SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE STOOD A SUM ##MER IN TOWN BUT SY ##D ##NEY OFTEN CALLED TILL HIS V ##AC ##ATION CAME AND A VO ##L ##UM ##IN ##OUS COR ##RES ##P ##OND ##ENCE WITH POL ##LY BEG ##U ##ILED THE LONG DAYS
TOM WR ##OTE ONCE A WEE ##K TO HIS MOTHER BUT THE LETTER ##S WERE SHORT AND NOT VERY SATISF ##ACT ##ORY FOR MEN NEVER DO TELL THE INTEREST ##ING LITTLE THINGS THAT WOMEN BEST LIKE TO HEAR
NO I M ONLY T ##IRED HAD A GOOD DEAL TO DO LATE ##LY AND THE DU ##LL WE ##ATHER MAKES ME JUST A TRI ##F ##LE BLUE
FORG ##IVE ME POL ##LY BUT I CAN ' T HELP SAYING IT FOR IT IS THERE AND I WANT TO BE AS TRUE TO YOU AS YOU WERE TO ME IF I CAN
I TRY NOT TO DEC ##E ##IVE MYSELF BUT IT DOES SEEM AS IF THERE WAS A CHANCE OF HAPP ##INESS FOR ME
THAN ##K HEAVEN FOR THAT
CRIED POL ##LY WITH THE HEART ##IEST SATISF ##ACT ##ION IN HER VOICE
POOR POL ##LY WAS SO TAKEN BY SURPR ##ISE THAT SHE HAD NOT A WORD TO SAY
NONE WERE NEED ##ED HER TELL ##T ##ALE FACE ANSWERED FOR HER AS WELL AS THE IMP ##UL ##SE WHICH MADE HER H ##IDE HER HEAD IN THE SO ##F ##A C ##USH ##ION LIKE A FOOL ##ISH O ##ST ##RIC ##H WHEN THE H ##UNT ##ERS ARE AFTER IT
ONCE OR TW ##ICE BUT SORT OF JO ##KING ##LY AND I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY SOME LITTLE FL ##IRT ##ATION
IT WAS SO ST ##UP ##ID OF ME NOT TO GU ##ESS BEFORE
IT WAS SO TEN ##DER EAR ##NE ##ST AND DEF ##IAN ##T THAT FAN ##NY FORGOT THE DEF ##ENCE OF HER OWN LOVE ##R IN ADM ##IR ##ATION OF POL ##LY ' S LO ##Y ##AL ##TY TO HER ##S FOR THIS FAITH ##FUL ALL ABS ##OR ##B ##ING LOVE WAS A NEW REV ##EL ##ATION TO FAN ##NY WHO WAS USED TO HEAR ##ING HER FRIENDS BO ##AST OF TWO OR THREE LOVE ##R ##S A YEAR AND CAL ##CUL ##ATE THEIR RESPECT ##IVE VAL ##UES WITH ALMOST AS MUCH CO ##OL ##NESS AS THE YOUNG MEN DISC ##USS ##ED THE FORT ##UNE ##S OF THE GIRLS THEY WISH ##ED FOR BUT COULD NOT AFF ##ORD TO MAR ##RY
I HOPE MAR ##IA B ##AIL ##EY IS ALL HE THINK ##S HER SHE ADDED SOFT ##LY FOR I COULD N ' T BEAR TO HAVE HIM DISAPP ##OINT ##ED AGAIN
SAID FAN ##NY TURN ##ING HOPE ##FUL ALL AT ONCE
SUPPOSE I SAY A WORD TO TOM JUST INQU ##IRE AFTER HIS HEART IN A GENERAL WAY YOU KNOW AND GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO TELL ME IF THERE IS ANYTHING TO TELL
BEAR IT PEOPLE ALWAYS DO BEAR THINGS SOME ##H ##OW ANSWERED POL ##LY LOOKING AS IF SENT ##ENCE HAD BEEN PASSED UPON HER
IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT WIN ##TER FROM THE LAST FOR BOTH THE GIRLS
IF FAN ##NY WANTED TO SHOW HIM WHAT SHE COULD DO TOWARD MAKING A PLEAS ##ANT HOME SHE CERTAINLY SUCC ##EE ##DE ##D BETTER THAN SHE SUS ##PECT ##ED FOR IN SP ##ITE OF MANY FA ##IL ##URES AND DISC ##OURA ##GE ##MENTS BEHIND THE SC ##ENE ##S THE LITTLE HOUSE BECAME A MOST ATT ##RA ##CT ##IVE PLACE TO MISTER SY ##D ##NEY AT LEAST FOR HE WAS MORE THE HOUSE FRIEND THAN EVER AND SEEMED DETERM ##INED TO PROV ##E THAT CHANGE OF FORT ##UNE MADE NO DIFFER ##ENCE TO HIM
SHE KEPT MUCH AT HOME WHEN THE DAY ' S WORK WAS DONE FIND ##ING IT PLEAS ##ANT ##ER TO SIT DREAM ##ING OVER BOOK OR SE ##W ##ING ALONE THAN TO EX ##ERT HERSELF EVEN TO GO TO THE SH ##AW ##S
POL ##LY WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE HERSELF THAT WIN ##TER AND THOSE NEAR ##EST TO HER SAW AND WONDER ##ED AT IT MOST
FOR NE ##D WAS SO ABS ##OR ##BED IN BUSINESS THAT HE I ##GN ##ORED THE WHOLE B ##AIL ##EY QUESTION AND LEFT THEM IN UT ##TER DARK ##NESS
FAN ##NY CAME WALK ##ING IN UPON HER ONE DAY LOOKING AS IF SHE BROUGHT T ##ID ##INGS OF SUCH GREAT JOY THAT SHE HARDLY KNEW HOW TO TELL THEM
BUT IF WORK B ##ASK ##ETS WERE GI ##FT ##ED WITH POWER ##S OF SPE ##E ##CH THEY COULD TELL STO ##RIE ##S MORE TRUE AND TEN ##DER THAN ANY WE READ
SHE HAD EVEN BEEN IN SOCI ##ETY BEFORE THE REV ##OL ##UTION
IT WAS HER PLEASURE AND HER VAN ##ITY TO DRA ##G IN THESE NAME ##S ON EVERY PRET ##E ##XT
EVERY YEAR SHE SOL ##EM ##N ##LY RE ##NE ##W ##ED HER VO ##W ##S AND AT THE MOMENT OF TAKING THE O ##ATH SHE SAID TO THE PR ##IEST MON ##SE ##IGN ##E ##UR SAINT FR ##AN ##CO ##IS GAVE IT TO MON ##SE ##IGN ##E ##UR SAINT J ##UL ##IE ##N MON ##SE ##IGN ##E ##UR SAINT J ##UL ##IE ##N GAVE IT TO MON ##SE ##IGN ##E ##UR SAINT E ##USE ##B ##IUS MON ##SE ##IGN ##E ##UR SAINT E ##USE ##B ##IUS GAVE IT TO MON ##SE ##IGN ##E ##UR SAINT PRO ##CO ##P ##IUS E ##T CE ##TER ##A E ##T CE ##TER ##A
AND THE SCHOOL GIRLS WOULD BEGIN TO LAUGH NOT IN THEIR SLE ##E ##VES BUT UNDER THEIR VE ##ILS CHAR ##MING LITTLE ST ##IF ##LED LAUGH ##S WHICH MADE THE VO ##C ##AL MOTHER ##S FR ##OWN
IT WAS A CENT ##URY WHICH SPOKE THROUGH HER BUT IT WAS THE EIGHTEEN ##TH CENT ##URY
THE RU ##LE OF FO ##N ##TE ##V ##RA ##ULT DID NOT FOR ##B ##ID THIS
SHE WOULD NOT SHOW THIS OBJECT TO ANY ##ONE
THUS IT FUR ##N ##ISHED A SUBJECT OF COMM ##ENT FOR ALL THOSE WHO WERE UN ##OC ##C ##UP ##IED OR BO ##RED IN THE CONV ##ENT

I WILL MAKE THAT MY SPE ##CI ##AL BUSINESS
GENERAL OBSER ##V ##ATIONS ON PRES ##ER ##VES CONF ##ECT ##ION ##ARY I ##CES AND DES ##SE ##R ##T DIS ##H ##ES
THE EXP ##ENSE OF PRES ##ER ##VING THEM WITH SU ##GAR IS A SER ##IOUS OBJECT ##ION FOR EXCEPT THE SU ##GAR IS USED IN CONSIDER ##ABLE QU ##ANT ##ITIES THE SUCCESS IS VERY UNC ##ERTAIN
FR ##U ##IT GATHER ##ED IN WE ##T OR FO ##GG ##Y WE ##ATHER WILL SOON BE MIL ##DE ##W ##ED AND BE OF NO SERV ##ICE FOR PRES ##ER ##VES
BUT TO DIST ##ING ##U ##ISH THESE PROPER ##LY REQU ##IRE ##S VERY GREAT ATTENTION AND CONSIDER ##ABLE EXPER ##IENCE
IF YOU D ##IP THE FING ##ER INTO THE SY ##RU ##P AND APP ##LY IT TO THE TH ##UMB THE TEN ##AC ##ITY OF THE SY ##RU ##P WILL ON SE ##PAR ##ATING THE FING ##ER AND TH ##UMB AFF ##ORD A THR ##EAD WHICH SHORT ##LY BREAK ##S THIS IS THE LITTLE THR ##EAD
LET IT BO ##IL UP AGAIN THEN TAKE IT OFF AND REM ##OVE CARE ##FULLY THE SC ##UM THAT HAS R ##ISE ##N

FOUR ##TEEN N ##INE ##TY N ##INE
BO ##IL THEM UP THREE DAYS SUCCESS ##IVE ##LY SK ##IM ##MING EACH TIME AND THEY WILL THEN BE FIN ##ISHED AND IN A STATE F ##IT TO BE PUT INTO PO ##TS FOR USE
THE REASON WHY THE FR ##U ##IT IS EM ##PT ##IED OUT OF THE PRES ##ER ##VING PA ##N INTO AN EARTH ##EN PA ##N IS THAT THE AC ##ID OF THE FR ##U ##IT ACT ##S UPON THE CO ##PPER OF WHICH THE PRES ##ER ##VING PA ##N ##S ARE US ##UALLY MADE
FROM THIS EXAM ##PLE THE PRO ##CESS OF PRES ##ER ##VING FR ##U ##ITS BY SY ##RU ##P WILL BE EAS ##ILY COMP ##RE ##H ##END ##ED
THEY SHOULD BE DRI ##ED IN THE STO ##VE OR O ##VEN ON A S ##IE ##VE AND TURNED EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRE ##SH PO ##W ##DER ##ED SU ##GAR BEING S ##IFT ##ED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEY ARE TURNED
IN THIS WAY IT IS ALSO THAT OR ##ANGE AND LE ##M ##ON CH ##IP ##S ARE PRES ##ER ##VED
MAR ##MA ##LA ##DE ##S J ##AM ##S AND FR ##U ##IT PAST ##ES ARE OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW IN VERY GENERAL REQU ##EST
MAR ##MA ##LA ##DE ##S AND J ##AM ##S DIFFER LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THEY ARE PRES ##ER ##VES OF A HALF LI ##QU ##ID CONS ##IST ##EN ##CY MADE BY BO ##ILING THE P ##UL ##P OF FR ##U ##ITS AND SOMETIMES PART OF THE R ##IND ##S WITH SU ##GAR
THAT THEY MAY KEEP IT IS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SP ##ARING OF SU ##GAR FIF ##TEEN O THREE
IN ALL THE OP ##ER ##ATIONS FOR PRES ##ER ##VE MAKING WHEN THE PRES ##ER ##VING PA ##N IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A TRI ##VE ##T UN ##LESS THE J ##AM IS MADE ON A HOT PLA ##TE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSARY
CONF ##ECT ##ION ##ARY FIF ##TEEN O EIGHT
IN SPEAK ##ING OF CONF ##ECT ##ION ##ARY IT SHOULD BE REMARK ##ED THAT ALL THE VAR ##IOUS PREP ##AR ##ATIONS ABOVE NAME ##D COME STRI ##CT ##LY SPEAK ##ING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VAR ##IOUS FR ##U ##ITS FLO ##W ##ERS HER ##BS RO ##OTS AND J ##U ##ICES WHICH WHEN BO ##ILED WITH SU ##GAR WERE FORM ##ER ##LY EM ##PL ##OY ##ED IN PH ##AR ##MA ##CY AS WELL AS FOR SWEET ##ME ##ATS WERE CALLED CONF ##ECT ##IONS FROM THE LA ##T ##IN WORD CONF ##ICE ##RE TO MAKE UP BUT THE TER ##M CONF ##ECT ##ION ##ARY EMB ##RA ##CES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KIND ##S OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPT ##ED IN THE ORD ##INARY C ##U ##IS ##INE
THE THOUSAND AND ONE OR ##N ##AME ##N ##T ##AL DIS ##H ##ES THAT AD ##ORN THE TABLE ##S OF THE WE ##ALTH ##Y SHOULD BE PUR ##CH ##ASED FROM THE CONF ##ECT ##ION ##ER THEY CANNOT PROF ##IT ##ABLY BE MADE AT HOME
HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE RE ##IGN ##S OF OUR TWO LAST GE ##OR ##GE ##S FA ##B ##UL ##OUS SUM ##S WERE OFTEN EXP ##END ##ED UPON FAN ##CI ##FUL DES ##SE ##R ##TS
THE SH ##APE OF THE DIS ##H ##ES VAR ##IES AT DIFFERENT PER ##I ##OD ##S THE PRE ##V ##AIL ##ING FA ##SH ##ION AT PRESENT BEING O ##VAL AND CIRC ##ULAR DIS ##H ##ES ON STE ##MS
I ##CES
AT DES ##SE ##R ##TS OR AT SOME EVENING PART ##IES I ##CES ARE SCARCE ##LY TO BE DISP ##ENSE ##D WITH
THE SP ##AD ##DLE IS GENERAL ##LY MADE OF CO ##PPER KEPT BRIGHT AND CLE ##AN
THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REP ##AST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THE TAKING THESE SUB ##ST ##ANCES DURING THE PRO ##CESS OF D ##IG ##EST ##ION IS AP ##T TO PROV ##OKE IND ##IS ##P ##OSITION
THERE WAS ONCE ON A TIME A W ##ID ##OWER WHO HAD A SON AND A DAUGHTER BY HIS FIRST WIFE
FROM THE VERY DAY THAT THE NEW WIFE CAME INTO THE HOUSE THERE WAS NO PEACE FOR THE MAN ' S CHILDREN AND NOT A CORN ##ER TO BE FOUND WHERE THEY COULD GET ANY REST SO THE BOY THOUGHT THAT THE BEST THING HE COULD DO WAS TO GO OUT INTO THE WORLD AND TRY TO EAR ##N HIS OWN BRE ##AD
BUT HIS SISTER WHO WAS STILL AT HOME FAR ##ED WOR ##SE AND WOR ##SE
K ##ISS ME GIRL SAID THE HEAD
WHEN THE KING ENTERED AND SAW IT HE STOOD STILL AS IF HE WERE IN FE ##T ##TERS AND COULD NOT ST ##IR FROM THE SP ##OT FOR THE PICT ##URE SEEMED TO HIM SO BEAUTIFUL
THE YOUTH PROM ##ISED TO MAKE ALL THE HAST ##E HE COULD AND SET FORTH FROM THE KING ' S PAL ##ACE
AT LAST THEY CAME IN SIGHT OF LAND
WELL IF MY BROTHER SAYS SO I MUST DO IT SAID THE MAN ' S DAUGHTER AND SHE FL ##UNG HER CA ##S ##KE ##T INTO THE SEA
WHAT IS MY BROTHER SAYING ASKED HIS SISTER AGAIN
ON THE FIRST TH ##UR ##S ##DAY NIGHT AFTER THIS A BEAUTIFUL MAID ##EN CAME INTO THE K ##ITCH ##EN OF THE PAL ##ACE AND BEG ##GED THE K ##ITCH ##EN MAID WHO SLE ##PT THERE TO LE ##ND HER A BR ##USH
SHE BEG ##GED VERY PRET ##T ##ILY AND GOT IT AND THEN SHE BR ##USHED HER HAIR AND THE GOLD DRO ##PPED FROM IT
OUT ON THEE U ##G ##LY BUS ##H ##Y BR ##IDE SLEEP ##ING SO SOFT BY THE YOUNG KING ' S SIDE ON SA ##ND AND STONE ##S MY BED I MAKE AND MY BROTHER SLEEP ##S WITH THE COLD SN ##AKE UN ##P ##IT ##IED AND UN ##W ##EPT
I SHALL COME TW ##ICE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN SAID SHE
THIS TIME ALSO AS BEFORE SHE BO ##R ##RO ##W ##ED A BR ##USH AND BR ##USHED HER HAIR WITH IT AND THE GOLD DRO ##PPED DOWN AS SHE DID IT AND AGAIN SHE SENT THE DOG OUT THREE TIMES AND WHEN DAY DA ##WN ##ED SHE DEP ##ART ##ED BUT AS SHE WAS GOING SHE SAID AS SHE HAD SAID BEFORE I SHALL COME ONCE MORE AND THEN NEVER AGAIN
NO ONE CAN TELL HOW DELIGHT ##ED THE KING WAS TO GET RID OF THAT H ##IDE ##OUS BUS ##H ##Y BR ##IDE AND GET A QUEEN WHO WAS BRIGHT AND BEAUTIFUL AS DAY ITSELF
W ##ILT THOU SERV ##E ME AND WATCH MY SEVEN FO ##ALS ASKED THE KING
THE YOUTH THOUGHT THAT IT WAS VERY EAS ##Y WORK TO WATCH THE FO ##ALS AND THAT HE COULD DO IT WELL ENOUGH
HAST THOU WATCH ##ED FAITH ##FULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LAD CAME INTO HIS PRES ##ENCE IN THE EVENING
YES THAT I HAVE SAID THE YOUTH
HE HAD GONE OUT ONCE TO SEE ##K A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN
THEN THE KING PROM ##ISED HIM THE SAME P ##UN ##ISH ##MENT AND THE SAME RE ##WARD THAT HE HAD PROM ##ISED HIS BROTHER
WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THE FO ##ALS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND T ##IRED HE PASSED BY A CLE ##FT IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SP ##IN ##NING WITH A DIST ##A ##FF AND SHE CALLED TO HIM
COME H ##ITHER COME H ##ITHER MY HANDS ##OME SON AND LET ME COM ##B YOUR HAIR
THE YOUTH LIKE ##D THE THOUGHT OF THIS LET THE FO ##ALS RUN WHERE THEY CH ##OSE AND SEA ##TED HIMSELF IN THE CLE ##FT OF THE ROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HA ##G
SO THERE HE SAT WITH HIS HEAD ON HER LA ##P TAKING HIS EAS ##E THE LIVE ##L ##ONG DAY
ON THE THIRD DAY C ##IND ##ER ##LA ##D WANTED TO SET OUT
THE TWO BROTHER ##S LAUGH ##ED AT HIM AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BEG ##GED HIM NOT TO GO BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE AND C ##IND ##ER ##LA ##D SET OUT ON HIS WAY
I AM WALK ##ING ABOUT IN SEA ##R ##CH OF A PLACE SAID C ##IND ##ER ##LA ##D
I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE THE PRINCESS SAID C ##IND ##ER ##LA ##D
AND THUS THEY JOUR ##NEY ##ED ON ##WARDS A LONG LONG WAY
WHEN THEY HAD GONE THUS FOR A LONG LONG WAY THE FO ##AL AGAIN ASKED DO ##ST THOU SEE ANYTHING NOW
YES NOW I SEE SOMETHING THAT IS WHITE SAID C ##IND ##ER ##LA ##D
IT LOOK ##S LIKE THE TR ##UN ##K OF A GREAT THICK B ##IRC ##H TREE
C ##IND ##ER ##LA ##D TRIED BUT COULD NOT DO IT SO HE HAD TO TAKE A DRA ##UGHT FROM THE P ##ITCH ##ER AND THEN ONE MORE AND AFTER THAT STILL ANOTHER AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO W ##IELD THE SW ##ORD WITH PERFECT EAS ##E
FOR WE ARE BROTHER ##S OF THE PRINCESS WHOM THOU ART TO HAVE WHEN THOU CAN ##ST TELL THE KING WHAT WE EAT AND DRINK BUT THERE IS A MIGHT ##Y TR ##OL ##L WHO HAS CAST A SPE ##LL OVER US
WHEN THEY HAD TRA ##VEL ##LED A LONG LONG WAY THE FO ##AL SAID DO ##ST THOU SEE ANYTHING
AND NOW INQU ##IRED THE FO ##AL SEE ##ST THOU NOTHING NOW
NOW THEN SAID THE FO ##AL DO ##ST THOU NOT SEE ANYTHING NOW
THAT IS A RIVER SAID THE FO ##AL AND WE HAVE TO CROSS IT
I HAVE DONE MY BEST REPLIED C ##IND ##ER ##LA ##D
ONCE UPON A TIME THERE WAS A KING IN THE NORTH WHO HAD WON MANY WAR ##S BUT NOW HE WAS OLD
THE OLD KING WENT OUT AND FO ##UGHT BRA ##VEL ##Y BUT AT LAST HIS SW ##ORD BR ##OKE AND HE WAS WO ##UND ##ED AND HIS MEN FLE ##D
BUT IN THE NIGHT WHEN THE BAT ##TLE WAS OVER HIS YOUNG WIFE CAME OUT AND SEA ##R ##CHED FOR HIM AMONG THE SLA ##IN AND AT LAST SHE FOUND HIM AND ASKED WHETHER HE MIGHT BE HEA ##LED
SO HE ASKED THE QUEEN HOW DO YOU KNOW IN THE DARK OF NIGHT WHETHER THE HOURS ARE WE ##ARING TO THE MORNING AND SHE SAID
THEN THE OLD MAN SAID DRI ##VE ALL THE HORSE ##S INTO THE RIVER AND CH ##OOSE THE ONE THAT SW ##IM ##S ACROSS
HE IS NO BIG ##GER THAN OTHER DRA ##G ##ONS SAID THE T ##UT ##OR AND IF YOU WERE AS BRA ##VE AS YOUR FATHER YOU WOULD NOT FEAR HIM
THEN THE PERSON WHO HAD K ##ILLED O ##T ##TER WENT DOWN AND CAUGHT THE D ##W ##AR ##F WHO OWN ##ED ALL THE TRE ##AS ##URE AND TOOK IT FROM HIM
ONLY ONE R ##ING WAS LEFT WHICH THE D ##W ##AR ##F WOR ##E AND EVEN THAT WAS TAKEN FROM HIM
SO REG ##IN MADE A SW ##ORD AND S ##IG ##UR ##D TRIED IT WITH A BL ##OW ON A LU ##M ##P OF IR ##ON AND THE SW ##ORD BR ##OKE
THEN S ##IG ##UR ##D WENT TO HIS MOTHER AND ASKED FOR THE BR ##OKEN PIE ##CES OF HIS FATHER ' S BLA ##DE AND GAVE THEM TO REG ##IN
SO S ##IG ##UR ##D SAID THAT SW ##ORD WOULD DO
THEN HE SAW THE TRA ##CK WHICH THE DRA ##G ##ON MADE WHEN HE WENT TO A CL ##IFF TO DRINK AND THE TRA ##CK WAS AS IF A GREAT RIVER HAD RO ##LLED ALONG AND LEFT A DEEP VAL ##LEY
BUT S ##IG ##UR ##D WAIT ##ED TILL HALF OF HIM HAD CRA ##W ##LED OVER THE P ##IT AND THEN HE THR ##UST THE SW ##ORD GRA ##M RIGHT INTO HIS VERY HEART
S ##IG ##UR ##D SAID I WOULD TOU ##CH NONE OF IT IF BY LO ##S ##ING IT I SHOULD NEVER DIE
BUT ALL MEN DIE AND NO BRA ##VE MAN LET ##S DEATH FRIGHT ##EN HIM FROM HIS DESIRE
DIE THOU FA ##F ##N ##IR AND THEN FA ##F ##N ##IR DIED
THEN S ##IG ##UR ##D RO ##DE BACK AND MET REG ##IN AND REG ##IN ASKED HIM TO RO ##AST FA ##F ##N ##IR ' S HEART AND LET HIM T ##AST ##E OF IT
SO S ##IG ##UR ##D PUT THE HEART OF FA ##F ##N ##IR ON A ST ##AKE AND RO ##AST ##ED IT
THERE IS S ##IG ##UR ##D RO ##AST ##ING FA ##F ##N ##IR ' S HEART FOR ANOTHER WHEN HE SHOULD T ##AST ##E OF IT HIMSELF AND LEAR ##N ALL W ##IS ##D ##OM
THAT LET HIM DO AND THEN RID ##E OVER H ##IND ##FE ##LL TO THE PLACE WHERE BR ##Y ##N ##H ##ILD SLEEP ##S
THERE MUST SHE SLEEP TILL THOU COMES ##T FOR HER WA ##KING R ##ISE UP AND RID ##E FOR NOW SURE SHE WILL SWE ##AR THE VO ##W FEAR ##LESS OF BREAK ##ING
THEN HE TOOK THE HEL ##ME ##T OFF THE HEAD OF THE SLEEP ##ER AND BEH ##OLD SHE WAS A MOST BEAUTIFUL LADY
THEN S ##IG ##UR ##D RO ##DE AWAY AND HE CAME TO THE HOUSE OF A KING WHO HAD A FAIR DAUGHTER
THEN BR ##Y ##N ##H ##ILD ' S FATHER TOLD GU ##N ##N ##AR THAT SHE WOULD MAR ##RY NONE BUT HIM WHO COULD RID ##E THE FL ##AME IN FRONT OF HER ENC ##H ##ANT ##ED TO ##W ##ER AND TH ##ITHER THEY RO ##DE AND GU ##N ##N ##AR SET HIS HORSE AT THE FL ##AME BUT HE WOULD NOT FACE IT
FOR ONE DAY WHEN BR ##Y ##N ##H ##ILD AND GU ##D ##RU ##N WERE BAT ##HING BR ##Y ##N ##H ##ILD WA ##DE ##D FAR ##TH ##EST OUT INTO THE RIVER AND SAID SHE DID THAT TO SHOW SHE WAS GU ##IR ##UN ' S SUPER ##IOR
FOR HER HUSBAND SHE SAID HAD RID ##DEN THROUGH THE FL ##AME WHEN NO OTHER MAN DA ##RED FACE IT
NOT LONG TO WAIT HE SAID TILL THE BIT ##TER SW ##ORD STAND ##S FAST IN MY HEART AND THOU WILL NOT LIVE LONG WHEN I AM DEAD

THERE ARE BO ##LT ##S ON THE DOOR WR ##ET ##CH
I DON ' T KNOW HOW IT IS BUT IT SEEMS TO ME AS IF I DO
NOW GO I CAN ' T KEEP MY EYES OPEN

ED ##U ##C ##ATION FAMILY FEELING THE SENSE OF DUT ##Y THE FAMILY ARE STRONG SENT ##INE ##LS BUT THERE ARE NO SENT ##INE ##LS SO VI ##G ##IL ##ANT AS NOT TO BE DEC ##E ##IVE ##D BY A GIRL OF SIX ##TEEN TO WHOM NATURE BY THE VOICE OF THE MAN SHE LOVE ##S GIVE ##S THE FIRST COUN ##SEL ##S OF LOVE ALL THE MORE AR ##DEN ##T BECAUSE THEY SEEM SO PUR ##E
THE MORE A GIRL BELIEVE ##S IN GOOD ##NESS THE MORE EAS ##ILY WILL SHE GIVE WAY IF NOT TO HER LOVE ##R AT LEAST TO LOVE FOR BEING WITHOUT MIST ##RU ##ST SHE IS WITHOUT FORCE AND TO WIN HER LOVE IS A TRI ##UMP ##H THAT CAN BE G ##AINED BY ANY YOUNG MAN OF FIVE AND TWENTY SEE HOW YOUNG GIRLS ARE WATCH ##ED AND GU ##ARD ##ED

WITH THEM THE BODY HAS WOR ##N OUT THE SOUL THE SENSE ##S HAVE BURN ##ED UP THE HEART DIS ##S ##IP ##ATION HAS BL ##UNT ##ED THE FEELING ##S
THEY LOVE BY PROF ##ESSION AND NOT BY INST ##INCT
WHEN A CREAT ##URE WHO HAS ALL HER PAST TO REP ##RO ##ACH HERSELF WITH IS TAKEN ALL AT ONCE BY A PROF ##OUND SINCE ##RE IR ##RES ##IST ##IBLE LOVE OF WHICH SHE HAD NEVER FELT HERSELF CAP ##ABLE WHEN SHE HAS CONF ##ESSED HER LOVE HOW ABS ##OL ##UTE ##LY THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVE ##S DO ##M ##IN ##ATES HER
THEY KNOW NOT WHAT PRO ##O ##F TO GIVE
IN ORDER TO DIST ##UR ##B THE LAB ##OUR ##ERS IN THE FIELD WAS ONE DAY DEV ##OUR ##ED BY A WO ##LF BECAUSE THOSE WHOM HE HAD SO OFTEN DEC ##E ##IVE ##D NO LONGER BELIEVE ##D IN HIS CR ##IES FOR HELP
IT IS THE SAME WITH THESE UN ##H ##APP ##Y WOMEN WHEN THEY LOVE SER ##IOUSLY
BUT WHEN THE MAN WHO INS ##P ##IRE ##S THIS RED ##EE ##MING LOVE IS GREAT ENOUGH IN SOUL TO REC ##E ##IVE IT WITHOUT REMEMBER ##ING THE PAST WHEN HE GIVE ##S HIMSELF UP TO IT WHEN IN SHORT HE LOVE ##S AS HE IS LOVED THIS MAN DRA ##INS AT ONE DRA ##UGHT ALL EARTH ##LY EM ##OT ##IONS AND AFTER SUCH A LOVE HIS HEART WILL BE CLOSE ##D TO EVERY OTHER
BUT TO RETURN TO THE FIRST DAY OF MY LI ##A ##ISON
WHEN I REACHED HOME I WAS IN A STATE OF MAD G ##A ##IET ##Y
THE WOMAN BECOME ##S THE MAN ' S MIST ##RESS AND LOVE ##S HIM
HOW WHY
MY WHOLE BEING WAS EX ##AL ##TED INTO JOY AT THE MEM ##ORY OF THE WORDS WE HAD EXC ##H ##ANGED DURING THAT FIRST NIGHT
HERE ARE MY ORDER ##S TO NIGHT AT THE V ##AU ##DE ##V ##ILL ##E
COME DURING THE THIRD ENT ##R ' ACT ##E
THE BOX ##ES FILLED ONE AFTER ANOTHER
ONLY ONE REM ##AINED EM ##PT ##Y THE ST ##AGE BOX
AT THE BEGIN ##NING OF THE THIRD ACT I HEARD THE DOOR OF THE BOX ON WHICH MY EYES HAD BEEN ALMOST CONST ##ANTLY FIX ##ED OPEN AND MAR ##G ##UE ##RI ##TE APPEARED
DID SHE LOVE ME ENOUGH TO BELIEVE THAT THE MORE BEAUTIFUL SHE LOOKED THE HAPP ##IER I SHOULD BE
WHAT IS THE MATTER WITH YOU TO NIGHT SAID MAR ##G ##UE ##RI ##TE R ##ISING AND COMING TO THE BACK OF THE BOX AND K ##ISS ##ING ME ON THE FORE ##H ##EAD
YOU SHOULD GO TO BED SHE REPLIED WITH THAT IR ##ON ##ICAL AIR WHICH WENT SO WELL WITH HER DEL ##IC ##ATE AND W ##ITT ##Y FACE
WHERE AT HOME
YOU STILL LOVE ME CAN YOU ASK
BECAUSE YOU DON ' T LIKE SEEING HIM
NONE ##TH ##ELESS I WAS VERY UN ##H ##APP ##Y ALL THE REST OF THE EVENING AND WENT AWAY VERY SAD ##LY AFTER HAVING SEEN PR ##UDE ##N ##CE THE COUNT AND MAR ##G ##UE ##RI ##TE GET INTO THE CAR ##RIAGE WHICH WAS WAIT ##ING FOR THEM AT THE DOOR
I HAVE NOT COME TO H ##IND ##ER YOU FROM LEA ##VING PAR ##IS
YOU IN THE WAY MAR ##G ##UE ##RI ##TE BUT HOW
WELL YOU MIGHT HAVE HAD A WOMAN HERE SAID PR ##UDE ##N ##CE AND IT WOULD HARDLY HAVE BEEN AM ##US ##ING FOR HER TO SEE TWO MORE ARRI ##VE
DURING THIS REMARK MAR ##G ##UE ##RI ##TE LOOKED AT ME ATT ##ENT ##IVE ##LY
MY DEAR PR ##UDE ##N ##CE I ANSWERED YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT YOU ARE SAYING
YES BUT BESIDES NOT WISH ##ING TO PUT YOU OUT I WAS SURE THAT IF YOU CAME AS FAR AS MY DOOR YOU WOULD WANT TO COME UP AND AS I COULD NOT LET YOU I DID NOT WISH TO LET YOU GO AWAY BLA ##MING ME FOR SAYING NO
BECAUSE I AM WATCH ##ED AND THE LEAST SUS ##P ##IC ##ION MIGHT DO ME THE GREAT ##EST HAR ##M
IS THAT REALLY THE ONLY REASON
IF THERE WERE ANY OTHER I WOULD TELL YOU FOR WE ARE NOT TO HAVE ANY SECRET ##S FROM ONE ANOTHER NOW
HON ##EST ##LY DO YOU CARE FOR ME A LITTLE A GREAT DEAL
I FAN ##CI ##ED FOR A MOMENT THAT I MIGHT GIVE MYSELF THAT HAPP ##INESS FOR SIX MONTH ##S YOU WOULD NOT HAVE IT YOU INS ##IST ##ED ON KNOW ##ING THE MEANS
WELL GOOD HEAVEN ##S THE MEANS WERE EAS ##Y ENOUGH TO GU ##ESS
I LIST ##ENED AND I G ##AZ ##ED AT MAR ##G ##UE ##RI ##TE WITH ADM ##IR ##ATION
WHEN I THOUGHT THAT THIS MAR ##VEL ##L ##OUS CREAT ##URE WHOSE FEET I HAD ONCE LONG ##ED TO K ##ISS WAS WILL ##ING TO LET ME TAKE MY PLACE IN HER THOUGHTS MY PART IN HER LIFE AND THAT I WAS NOT YET CONT ##ENT WITH WHAT SHE GAVE ME I ASKED IF MAN ' S DESIRE HAS INDEED LIM ##ITS WHEN SATISF ##IED AS PROM ##PT ##LY AS MINE HAD BEEN IT REACHED AFTER SOMETHING FURTHER
TR ##UL ##Y SHE CONTINUED WE POOR CREAT ##URES OF CHANCE HAVE FAN ##T ##AST ##IC DESIRE ##S AND INC ##ON ##CEI ##V ##ABLE LOVE ##S
WE ARE NOT ALL ##OWED TO HAVE HEART ##S UNDER PEN ##AL ##TY OF BEING HO ##OTE ##D DOWN AND OF RU ##INING OUR CRE ##D ##IT
WE NO LONGER BELONG TO OUR ##SELVES
WE STAND FIRST IN THEIR SELF EST ##EE ##M LAST IN THEIR EST ##EE ##M
NEVER DO THEY GIVE YOU ADV ##ICE WHICH IS NOT LU ##C ##RA ##T ##IVE
IT MEANS LITTLE ENOUGH TO THEM THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TEN LOVE ##R ##S EXT ##RA AS LONG AS THEY GET DRESS ##ES OR A BRA ##CE ##LE ##T OUT OF THEM AND THAT THEY CAN DRI ##VE IN OUR CAR ##RIAGE FROM TIME TO TIME OR COME TO OUR BOX AT THE THE ##AT ##RE
SUCH A MAN I FOUND IN THE DU ##KE BUT THE DU ##KE IS OLD AND OLD AGE NEITHER PROT ##ECT ##S NOR CONS ##OL ##ES
I THOUGHT I COULD ACCEPT THE LIFE WHICH HE OFF ##ERED ME BUT WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE
WHAT I LOVED IN YOU WAS NOT THE MAN WHO WAS BUT THE MAN WHO WAS GOING TO BE
MAR ##G ##UE ##RI ##TE T ##IRED OUT WITH THIS LONG CONF ##ESSION THR ##EW HERSELF BACK ON THE SO ##F ##A AND TO ST ##IF ##LE A SLIGHT CO ##UG ##H PUT UP HER HAND ##KE ##R ##CH ##IEF TO HER LIPS AND FROM THAT TO HER EYES
MAR ##G ##UE ##RI ##TE DO WITH ME AS YOU WILL I AM YOUR SLA ##VE YOUR DOG BUT IN THE NAME OF HEAVEN TEAR UP THE LETTER WHICH I WR ##OTE TO YOU AND DO NOT MAKE ME LEAVE YOU TO MOR ##RO ##W IT WOULD K ##ILL ME
MAR ##G ##UE ##RI ##TE DREW THE LETTER FROM HER BO ##SO ##M AND HAND ##ING IT TO ME WITH A SMILE OF INF ##IN ##ITE SWEET ##NESS SAID
HERE IT IS I HAVE BROUGHT IT BACK
I TO ##RE THE LETTER INTO FR ##AG ##MENTS AND K ##ISS ##ED WITH TEARS THE HAND THAT GAVE IT TO ME
LOOK HERE PR ##UDE ##N ##CE DO YOU KNOW WHAT HE WANT ##S SAID MAR ##G ##UE ##RI ##TE
HE WANT ##S YOU TO FORG ##IVE HIM
ONE HAS TO BUT HE WANT ##S MORE THAN THAT WHAT THEN

MAR ##IUS WAS CLEAR EYE ##D AND HE REQU ##IRED THE TRUE LIGHT
THE HALF LIGHT ##S OF DOUBT PAIN ##ED HIM
WHATEVER MAY HAVE BEEN HIS DESIRE TO REM ##AIN WHERE HE WAS HE COULD NOT HA ##LT THERE HE WAS IR ##RES ##IST ##IB ##LY CONST ##RA ##INED TO CONTIN ##UE TO ADV ##ANCE TO EXAM ##INE TO THINK TO MAR ##CH FURTHER
HE FEAR ##ED AFTER HAVING TAKEN SO MANY STEP ##S WHICH HAD BROUGHT HIM NEAR ##ER TO HIS FATHER TO NOW TAKE A STEP WHICH SHOULD EST ##RA ##NG ##E HIM FROM THAT FATHER
HIS DISC ##OM ##FORT WAS A ##UG ##MENT ##ED BY ALL THE REF ##LE ##CTION ##S WHICH OCC ##UR ##RED TO HIM

REQU ##EST COUR ##FE ##Y ##RA ##C TO COME AND TALK WITH ME SAID MAR ##IUS
WHAT IS TO BECOME OF YOU SAID COUR ##FE ##Y ##RA ##C
WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO I DO NOT KNOW
SIL ##VER GOLD HERE IT IS
YOU WILL THEN HAVE ONLY A PA ##IR OF TR ##OUSE ##R ##S A WA ##IST ##CO ##AT A HAT AND A CO ##AT AND MY BO ##OTS

THE LAND ##L ##ORD PRESENT ##ED HIS BILL WHICH HAD TO BE PA ##ID ON THE SP ##OT
I HAVE TEN FR ##AN ##C ##S LEFT SAID MAR ##IUS
THAT WILL BE SW ##ALL ##OWING A TO ##NG ##UE VERY FAST OR A HUNDRED SOU ##S VERY SLOWLY
ONE MORNING ON HIS RETURN FROM THE LAW SCHOOL MAR ##IUS FOUND A LETTER FROM HIS AUNT AND THE SIX ##TY P ##IST ##OL ##ES THAT IS TO SAY SIX HUNDRED FR ##AN ##C ##S IN GOLD IN A SEA ##LED BOX

AT THAT MOMENT HE HAD THREE FR ##AN ##C ##S LEFT
HE PER ##CEIVED THAT IT WAS NO GOOD TALK ##ING TO THE OLD MAN AND THAT THE PRINCI ##P ##AL PERSON IN THE HOUSE WAS THE MOTHER
BEFORE HER HE DEC ##IDED TO SC ##ATTER HIS PE ##AR ##LS
THE PRINCESS WAS DIST ##RA ##CTED AND DID NOT KNOW WHAT TO DO SHE FELT SHE HAD S ##IN ##NED AGAINST K ##ITT ##Y
WELL DOCTOR DEC ##IDE OUR FAT ##E SAID THE PRINCESS TELL ME EVERYTHING
IS THERE HOPE SHE MEANT TO SAY BUT HER LIPS QU ##IVER ##ED AND SHE COULD NOT UT ##TER THE QUESTION WELL DOCTOR
AS YOU PLEASE THE PRINCESS WENT OUT WITH A S ##IGH
THE FAMILY DOCTOR RESPECT ##FULLY CE ##ASED IN THE MID ##DLE OF HIS OBSER ##V ##ATIONS

HE ASKED AH IT IS
OH WELL THEN I CAN DO IT IN TWENTY MINUTES
AND HOW ABOUT A TOU ##R AB ##RO ##AD ASKED THE FAMILY DOCTOR
WHAT IS WANTED IS MEANS OF IMP ##RO ##VING N ##UT ##RI ##T ##ION AND NOT FOR LOW ##ERING IT
THE FAMILY DOCTOR LIST ##ENED ATT ##ENT ##IVE ##LY AND RESPECT ##FULLY
BUT IN FAV ##OR OF FORE ##IGN TRA ##VEL I WOULD U ##R ##GE THE CHANGE OF HA ##BIT ##S THE REM ##OV ##AL FROM COND ##ITION ##S CALL ##ING UP REM ##IN ##IS ##CE ##N ##CES
AND THEN THE MOTHER WISH ##ES IT HE ADDED
AH WELL IN THAT CASE TO BE SURE LET THEM GO ONLY THOSE GE ##R ##MAN QU ##ACK ##S ARE MIS ##CH ##IE ##V ##OUS
OH TIME ' S UP ALREADY AND HE WENT TO THE DOOR
THE CE ##LE ##BR ##ATED DOCTOR ANN ##OUN ##CED TO THE PRINCESS A FEELING OF WHAT WAS DU ##E FROM HIM D ##ICT ##ATED HIS DOING SO THAT HE OUGHT TO SEE THE PAT ##IENT ONCE MORE
OH NO ONLY A FEW DET ##AIL ##S PRINCESS COME THIS WAY
AND THE MOTHER ACCOM ##P ##AN ##IED BY THE DOCTOR WENT INTO THE DRAW ##ING ROOM TO K ##ITT ##Y
WHEN THE DOCTOR CAME IN SHE FL ##USHED CR ##IM ##SON AND HER EYES FILLED WITH TEARS
SHE ANSWERED HIM AND ALL AT ONCE GOT UP FUR ##IOUS
EXC ##USE ME DOCTOR BUT THERE IS REALLY NO OBJECT IN THIS
THIS IS THE THIRD TIME YOU ' VE ASKED ME THE SAME THING
THE CE ##LE ##BR ##ATED DOCTOR DID NOT TAKE OFF ##ENSE
NE ##R ##V ##OUS IR ##RI ##T ##AB ##ILITY HE SAID TO THE PRINCESS WHEN K ##ITT ##Y HAD LEFT THE ROOM HOWEVER I HAD FIN ##ISHED
AND THE DOCTOR BEGAN SC ##IENT ##IFIC ##ALLY EXPL ##AIN ##ING TO THE PRINCESS AS AN EXCEPT ##ION ##ALLY INTELL ##IG ##ENT WOMAN THE COND ##ITION OF THE YOUNG PRINCESS AND CON ##CL ##UDE ##D BY INS ##IST ##ING ON THE DRINK ##ING OF THE WATER ##S WHICH WERE CERTAINLY HAR ##M ##LESS
AT THE QUESTION SHOULD THEY GO AB ##RO ##AD THE DOCTOR PL ##UNG ##ED INTO DEEP MED ##IT ##ATION AS THOUGH RESOL ##VING A WE ##IGHT ##Y PROB ##LE ##M
FIN ##ALLY HIS DEC ##IS ##ION WAS PRO ##N ##OUN ##CED THEY WERE TO GO AB ##RO ##AD BUT TO PUT NO FAITH IN FORE ##IGN QU ##ACK ##S AND TO APP ##LY TO HIM IN ANY NEED
IT SEEMED AS THOUGH SOME PIE ##CE OF GOOD FORT ##UNE HAD COME TO PASS AFTER THE DOCTOR HAD GONE
THE MOTHER WAS MUCH MORE CHE ##ER ##FUL WHEN SHE WENT BACK TO HER DAUGHTER AND K ##ITT ##Y PRET ##END ##ED TO BE MORE CHE ##ER ##FUL
ED ##U ##C ##ATED PEOPLE OF THE UP ##PER CLASS ##ES ARE TRY ##ING TO ST ##IF ##LE THE EVER GR ##OWING SENSE OF THE NECESS ##ITY OF TRANS ##FORM ##ING THE EXIST ##ING SOCI ##AL ORDER

THE POSS ##IB ##ILITY OF APP ##LY ##ING BO ##D ##ILY VI ##OL ##ENCE TO PEOPLE IS PROV ##IDED ABOVE ALL BY AN OR ##G ##AN ##IZ ##ATION OF ARM ##ED MEN TRA ##INED TO ACT IN UN ##ISON IN SUB ##M ##ISS ##ION TO ONE WILL
THESE B ##AND ##S OF ARM ##ED MEN SUB ##M ##ISS ##IVE TO A SING ##LE WILL ARE WHAT CONST ##IT ##UTE THE ARM ##Y
THE ARM ##Y HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL IS THE B ##AS ##IS OF POWER
POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTR ##OL THE ARM ##Y AND ALL MEN IN POWER FROM THE ROM ##AN CA ##ES ##ARS TO THE RU ##S ##S ##IAN AND GE ##R ##MAN EM ##PER ##ORS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARM ##Y THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT PO ##P ##ULAR ##ITY IN THE ARM ##Y KNOW ##ING THAT IF THAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER IS SEC ##URE
INDEED IT COULD NOT BE OTHER ##W ##ISE
ONLY UNDER THOSE COND ##ITION ##S COULD THE SOCI ##AL OR ##G ##AN ##IZ ##ATION BE JUST ##IFIED
BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTR ##ARY MEN IN POWER ARE ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SAINT ##S THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSS ##ESSION OF POWER THE SOCI ##AL OR ##G ##AN ##IZ ##ATION B ##ASED ON POWER HAS NO JUST ##IFIC ##ATION
EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN O ##W ##ING TO THE LOW STAND ##ARD OF MOR ##ALS AND THE DISP ##OSITION OF MEN TO VI ##OL ##ENCE THE EXIST ##ENCE OF AN AUTHOR ##ITY TO REST ##RA ##IN SUCH VI ##OL ##ENCE WAS AN ADV ##ANT ##AGE BECAUSE THE VI ##OL ##ENCE OF GOVERN ##MENT WAS LESS THAN THE VI ##OL ##ENCE OF IND ##IV ##ID ##UAL ##S ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADV ##ANT ##AGE COULD NOT BE LAST ##ING
BETWEEN THE MEM ##BER ##S OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SING ##LE AUTHOR ##ITY THE STRI ##FE BETWEEN IND ##IV ##ID ##UAL ##S SEEMS STILL LESS AND THE LIFE OF THE STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SEC ##URE
IT WAS PRODU ##CED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GR ##OW ##TH OF PO ##P ##UL ##ATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STR ##UGG ##LE AND CON ##QU ##EST
AFTER CON ##QU ##EST THE POWER OF THE EM ##PER ##OR PUT ##S AN END TO INTER ##N ##AL DIS ##SE ##N ##S ##IONS AND SO THE STATE CON ##CEPT ##ION OF LIFE JUST ##IF ##IES ITSELF
BUT THIS JUST ##IFIC ##ATION IS NEVER MORE THAN TEM ##P ##OR ##ARY
INTER ##N ##AL DIS ##SE ##N ##S ##IONS DISAPP ##EAR ONLY IN PROP ##ORT ##ION TO THE DE ##GR ##EE OF OPP ##RESS ##ION EX ##ERT ##ED BY THE AUTHOR ##ITY OVER THE DIS ##SE ##N ##T ##IENT IND ##IV ##ID ##UAL ##S

AND THEREFORE THE OPP ##RESS ##ION OF THE OPP ##RESSED ALWAYS GO ##ES ON GR ##OWING UP TO THE FUR ##TH ##EST LIM ##IT BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT K ##ILL ##ING THE GO ##OSE WITH THE GOLD ##EN E ##GG ##S
THE MOST CONV ##IN ##CING EXAM ##PLE OF THIS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE COND ##ITION OF THE WORK ##ING CLASS ##ES OF OUR E ##P ##OC ##H WHO ARE IN REAL ##ITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLA ##VES OF AN ##CIENT TIMES SUB ##DU ##ED BY CON ##QU ##EST
SO IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN
FOOT ##NOT ##E THE FACT THAT IN AMERIC ##A THE AB ##USE ##S OF AUTHOR ##ITY EXIST IN SP ##ITE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TR ##OO ##PS NOT ONLY FA ##ILS TO DISP ##RO ##VE THIS POSITION BUT PO ##S ##IT ##IVE ##LY CONF ##IR ##MS IT
THE UP ##PER CLASS ##ES KNOW THAT AN ARM ##Y OF FIFTY THOUSAND WILL SOON BE INS ##UFF ##IC ##IENT AND NO LONGER REL ##YING ON P ##INK ##ERT ##ON ' S MEN THEY FEEL THAT THE SEC ##UR ##ITY OF THEIR POSITION DEP ##END ##S ON THE INC ##RE ##ASED STRENGTH OF THE ARM ##Y
THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESS ##ION IS ES ##SE ##N ##T ##IAL ##LY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KING ##S AND THE PO ##PE ##S ENG ##AGE SW ##ISS AND SC ##OT ##CH GU ##ARDS AND MAKES THE RU ##S ##S ##IAN AUTHOR ##ITIES OF TO DAY SO CARE ##FULLY DIST ##RIB ##UTE THE REC ##RU ##ITS SO THAT THE REG ##IMENT ##S FROM THE FRONT ##IERS ARE ST ##ATION ##ED IN CENT ##RA ##L DIST ##RIC ##TS AND THE REG ##IMENT ##S FROM THE CENT ##ER ARE ST ##ATION ##ED ON THE FRONT ##IERS
THE MEAN ##ING OF CAP ##RI ##V ##I ' S SPE ##E ##CH PUT INTO PLAIN LA ##NG ##U ##AGE IS THAT F ##UND ##S ARE NEED ##ED NOT TO RES ##IST FORE ##IGN FO ##ES BUT TO BU ##Y UNDER OFFIC ##ERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THE EN ##S ##LA ##VED TO ##ILING MA ##S ##SE ##S
AND THIS AB ##N ##ORM ##AL ORDER OF THINGS IS MAIN ##TAINED BY THE ARM ##Y
BUT THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE GOVERN ##MENT THERE ARE OTHER GOVERN ##MENTS EXPL ##O ##ITING THEIR SUBJECT ##S BY VI ##OL ##ENCE IN THE SAME WAY AND ALWAYS READY TO PO ##UN ##CE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERN ##MENT AND CARRY OFF THE FR ##U ##ITS OF THE TO ##IL OF ITS EN ##S ##LA ##VED SUBJECT ##S
AND SO EVERY GOVERN ##MENT NEED ##S AN ARM ##Y ALSO TO PROT ##ECT ITS BO ##OT ##Y FROM ITS NEIGHB ##OR BR ##IG ##AND ##S
THIS INC ##RE ##ASE IS CONT ##AG ##IOUS AS MON ##TE ##S ##QU ##IE ##U POINT ##ED OUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO
EVERY INC ##RE ##ASE IN THE ARM ##Y OF ONE STATE WITH THE A ##IM OF SELF DEF ##ENSE AGAINST ITS SUBJECT ##S BECOME ##S A SOU ##R ##CE OF DANGER FOR NEIGHB ##OR ##ING STATE ##S AND CALL ##S FOR A SIM ##IL ##AR INC ##RE ##ASE IN THEIR ARM ##IES
THE DESP ##OT ##ISM OF A GOVERN ##MENT ALWAYS INC ##RE ##ASE ##S WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARM ##Y AND ITS EXT ##ERN ##AL SUCCESS ##ES AND THE AG ##GR ##ESS ##IVE ##NESS OF A GOVERN ##MENT INC ##RE ##ASE ##S WITH ITS INTER ##N ##AL DESP ##OT ##ISM
THE R ##IV ##AL ##RY OF THE E ##UR ##OP ##E ##AN STATE ##S IN CONST ##ANTLY INC ##RE ##AS ##ING THEIR FORCE ##S HAS RED ##U ##CED THEM TO THE NECESS ##ITY OF HAVING RECO ##UR ##SE TO UN ##IVER ##S ##AL MIL ##IT ##ARY SERV ##ICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREAT ##EST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLD ##IERS IS OB ##TAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXP ##ENSE
AND BY THIS MEANS ALL C ##IT ##IZE ##N ##S ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPP ##ORT THE IN ##I ##QU ##ITIES PRACT ##ICED UPON THEM ALL C ##IT ##IZE ##N ##S HAVE BECOME THEIR OWN OPP ##RESS ##ORS
THIS INC ##ONS ##IST ##EN ##CY HAS BECOME OB ##V ##IOUS IN UN ##IVER ##S ##AL MIL ##IT ##ARY SERV ##ICE
IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGN ##IFIC ##ANCE OF THE SOCI ##AL CON ##CEPT ##ION OF LIFE CONS ##ISTS IN MAN ' S RECO ##GN ##ITION OF THE BAR ##B ##AR ##ITY OF STRI ##FE BETWEEN IND ##IV ##ID ##UAL ##S AND THE TRANS ##IT ##OR ##INESS OF PERSON ##AL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANS ##FE ##REN ##CE OF THE A ##IM OF LIFE TO GR ##OU ##PS OF PERSON ##S
BUT WITH UN ##IVER ##S ##AL MIL ##IT ##ARY SERV ##ICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SA ##CRI ##F ##ICE TO GET RID OF THE CR ##UE ##LT ##Y OF STRI ##FE AND THE INS ##E ##C ##UR ##ITY OF EXIST ##ENCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PER ##ILS THEY HAD MEANT TO AV ##O ##ID
BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXP ##OSE THE IND ##IV ##ID ##UAL ##S TO THE SAME NECESS ##ITY OF STRI ##FE SUB ##ST ##IT ##UT ##ING STRI ##FE WITH IND ##IV ##ID ##UAL ##S OF OTHER STATE ##S FOR STRI ##FE WITH NEIGHB ##ORS
THE T ##A ##X ##ES RA ##ISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREP ##AR ##ATIONS ABS ##OR ##B THE GREAT ##ER PART OF THE PRODU ##CE OF LAB ##OR WHICH THE ARM ##Y OUGHT TO DEF ##END
THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RE ##NDER ##S ALL REF ##ORM ##S OF LIFE SOCI ##AL LIFE V ##AIN AND FR ##U ##IT ##LESS
BUT THE FAT ##AL SIGN ##IFIC ##ANCE OF UN ##IVER ##S ##AL MIL ##IT ##ARY SERV ##ICE AS THE MAN ##IFE ##ST ##ATION OF THE CONTR ##AD ##ICT ##ION IN ##HERE ##N ##T IN THE SOCI ##AL CON ##CEPT ##ION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APP ##ARE ##N ##T IN THAT
GOVERN ##MENTS ASS ##ERT THAT ARM ##IES ARE NEED ##ED ABOVE ALL FOR EXT ##ERN ##AL DEF ##ENSE BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE
THEY ARE NEED ##ED PRINCI ##P ##ALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECT ##S AND EVERY MAN UNDER UN ##IVER ##S ##AL MIL ##IT ##ARY SERV ##ICE BECOME ##S AN ACCOM ##PL ##ICE IN ALL THE ACT ##S OF VI ##OL ##ENCE OF THE GOVERN ##MENT AGAINST THE C ##IT ##IZE ##N ##S WITHOUT ANY CH ##O ##ICE OF HIS OWN
AND FOR THE SA ##KE OF WHAT AM I MAKING THEM
I AM EXPECT ##ED FOR THE SA ##KE OF THE STATE TO MAKE THESE SA ##CRI ##F ##ICES TO RE ##N ##OUN ##CE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRE ##CIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SEC ##UR ##ITY AND HUMAN D ##IGN ##ITY
EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXP ##OSED TO THE ATT ##ACK ##S OF EV ##IL DISP ##OSED PERSON ##S IN OUR OWN COUNTRY
WE KNOW NOW THAT THR ##E ##ATS AND P ##UN ##ISH ##MENTS CANNOT D ##IM ##IN ##ISH THEIR NUMBER THAT THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF EN ##V ##IR ##ON ##MENT AND MOR ##AL INFL ##UE ##N ##CE
SO THAT THE JUST ##IFIC ##ATION OF STATE VI ##OL ##ENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROT ##ECT ##ION IT GIVE ##S US FROM EV ##IL DISP ##OSED PERSON ##S EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUND ##ATION THREE OR FOUR CENT ##UR ##IES AGO HAS NONE WHATEVER NOW
EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY REL ##IG ##ION ED ##U ##C ##ATION C ##ULT ##URE MEANS OF COMM ##UN ##IC ##ATION AND SO ON
WITHOUT THE STATE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCI ##AL INST ##IT ##UTION ##S NEED ##ED FOR DOING ANY THING
THIS AR ##G ##UM ##ENT TOO WAS WELL FOUND ##ED ONLY SOME CENT ##UR ##IES AGO
THE GREAT EXT ##ENS ##ION OF MEANS OF COMM ##UN ##IC ##ATION AND INTER ##CH ##ANGE OF IDEA ##S HAS MADE MEN COMPLE ##TE ##LY ABLE TO DISP ##ENSE WITH STATE A ##ID IN FORM ##ING SOCI ##ET ##IES ASS ##OC ##IA ##T ##IONS COR ##P ##OR ##ATIONS AND CON ##GR ##ESS ##ES FOR SC ##IENT ##IFIC E ##CO ##N ##OM ##IC AND POL ##IT ##ICAL OBJECT ##S
WITHOUT GOVERN ##MENTS NAT ##IONS WOULD BE EN ##S ##LA ##VED BY THEIR NEIGHB ##ORS
THE GOVERN ##MENT THEY TELL US WITH ITS ARM ##Y IS NECESSARY TO DEF ##END US FROM NEIGHB ##OR ##ING STATE ##S WHO MIGHT EN ##S ##LA ##VE US
AND IF DEF ##ENSE AGAINST BAR ##B ##AR ##OUS NAT ##IONS IS MEANT ONE THOUSAND ##TH PART OF THE TR ##OO ##PS NOW UNDER ARMS WOULD BE AM ##PLY SUFF ##IC ##IENT FOR THAT PURPOSE
THE POWER OF THE STATE FAR FROM BEING A SEC ##UR ##ITY AGAINST THE ATT ##ACK ##S OF OUR NEIGHB ##ORS EXP ##OSE ##S US ON THE CONTR ##ARY TO MUCH GREAT ##ER DANGER OF SUCH ATT ##ACK ##S
EVEN LOOKING AT IT PRACT ##ICALLY WE ##IGH ##ING THAT IS TO SAY ALL THE BUR ##DEN ##S LAID ON HIM BY THE STATE NO MAN CAN FA ##IL TO SEE THAT FOR HIM PERSON ##ALLY TO COMP ##LY WITH STATE DEM ##AND ##S AND SERV ##E IN THE ARM ##Y WOULD IN THE MAJ ##OR ##ITY OF CASE ##S BE MORE DIS ##AD ##V ##ANT ##AGE ##OUS THAN TO REF ##USE TO DO SO
TO RES ##IST WOULD NEED INDE ##PEND ##ENT THOUGHT AND EFF ##ORT OF WHICH EVERY MAN IS NOT CAP ##ABLE
SO MUCH FOR THE ADV ##ANT ##AGES AND DIS ##AD ##V ##ANT ##AGES OF BOTH LINE ##S OF COND ##UCT FOR A MAN OF THE WE ##ALTH ##Y CLASS ##ES AN OPP ##RESS ##OR
FOR A MAN OF THE POOR WORK ##ING CLASS THE ADV ##ANT ##AGES AND DIS ##AD ##V ##ANT ##AGES WILL BE THE SAME BUT WITH A GREAT INC ##RE ##ASE OF DIS ##AD ##V ##ANT ##AGES

M ##IKE BECAME UN ##E ##AS ##Y AND FISH ##ED AN EL ##AST ##IC B ##AND OUT OF HIS POCK ##ET MADE A FL ##ICK OF PAPER AND SENT IT SO ##ARING OUT INTO M STREET
WELL HE ADM ##ITTED I DID
CHR ##IS ASKED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY THE HEAVY WE ##IGHT HE CARRIED WITHIN HIM LI ##FT ##ED AND LIGHT ##ENED A LITTLE
THINK HE REALLY NEED ##S IT HE PUR ##S ##UED
HE WOULD HAVE LIKE ##D TO GET THE JO ##B FOR J ##AKE ##Y WHO NEED ##ED IT BUT SOME ##H ##OW THE T ##ASK OF FA ##CING MISTER W ##ICK ##ER ES ##PE ##CI ##ALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND DU ##S ##K ED ##GING INTO THE STREET ##S WAS NOT WHAT CHR ##IS HAD INT ##END ##ED FOR END ##ING THE AFTER ##N ##OON

M ##IKE WAS STANDING ON THE CORN ##ER
AW SH ##UCK ##S
CHR ##IS START ##ED OFF ONCE MORE PASS ##ING THE BL ##E ##AK LITTLE VICT ##OR ##IAN CHURCH PER ##CHED ON THE HILL ABOVE MISTER W ##ICK ##ER ' S HOUSE
AN EM ##PT ##Y LO ##T CUT INTO BY CHURCH LA ##NE GAVE A LOOK OF IS ##OL ##ATION TO THE L SH ##APE ##D BR ##ICK BUILD ##ING THAT SERV ##ED MISTER W ##ICK ##ER AS BOTH HOUSE AND PLACE OF BUSINESS
THE LONGER WIN ##G TOWARD THE BACK HAD A BACK DOOR THAT OPENED ON ##TO WATER STREET THE SP ##ACE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND W ##IS ##CO ##N ##S ##IN AV ##EN ##UE HAD BEEN MADE INTO A NE ##AT OBL ##ONG FLO ##W ##ER GARDEN FE ##N ##CED OFF FROM THE SIDE ##W ##ALK BY BOX SH ##RU ##BS AND A WHITE P ##ICK ##ET FE ##N ##CE
A LI ##V ##ID YE ##LLOW ST ##AINED THE HOR ##IZ ##ON BEYOND THE FACT ##OR ##IES AND GRA ##Y CL ##OUD ##S LOW ##ERED AND T ##UMB ##LED ABOVE
THE AIR WAS GR ##OWING CH ##ILL AND CHR ##IS DEC ##IDED TO FIN ##ISH HIS JO ##B
ALL AT ONCE HE WONDER ##ED HOW HIS MOTHER WAS AND EVERYTHING IN HIM P ##IN ##CHED AND T ##IGHT ##ENED ITSELF
AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL HE REACHED THE HOUSE
THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT ALWAYS CAUGHT HIS EYE AM ##ID THE LI ##T ##TER OF DU ##ST ##Y PIE ##CES
ON THE LEFT THE CO ##IL OF RO ##PE IN THE CENT ##ER THE MO ##DE ##L OF A SA ##ILING SHIP IN A GREEN GLASS BO ##T ##TLE AND ON THE RIGHT THE WOOD ##EN ST ##AT ##UE OF A NE ##GR ##O BOY IN B ##AG ##GY TR ##OUSE ##R ##S T ##UR ##K ##ISH J ##ACK ##ET AND WHITE T ##UR ##B ##AN
BUT THE NAME STILL SHOW ##ED AT THE PRO ##W AND MANY A TIME CHR ##IS SA ##FE AT HOME IN BED HAD SA ##ILED IMAG ##INARY VO ##Y ##AGES IN THE M ##IR ##AB ##ELL ##E
HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANY ##ONE GO INTO MISTER W ##ICK ##ER ' S SHO ##P NOW HE THOUGHT OF IT
HOW THEN DID HE LIVE AND WHAT DID HE EVER SE ##LL
A SUDDEN CAR HOR ##N WO ##KE HIM FROM HIS DREAM
OF THE MANY TIMES HE HAD EXAM ##INED MISTER W ##ICK ##ER ' S WINDOW AND PO ##RED OVER THE RO ##PE THE SHIP AND THE N ##UB ##IAN BOY HE HAD NEVER GONE INTO MISTER W ##ICK ##ER ' S SHO ##P
SO NOW ALONE UNTIL SOME ##ONE SHOULD ANSWER THE BELL HE LOOKED E ##AGER ##LY IF UN ##E ##AS ##ILY AROUND HIM
WHAT WITH THE ONE WINDOW AND THE LOW ##ERING DAY OUT ##SIDE THE LONG N ##ARR ##OW SHO ##P WAS SOM ##BER
HEAVY HAND HE ##WN BE ##AM ##S CROSS ##ED IT FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER
MISTER W ##ICK ##ER ' S BACK BEING TOWARD THE SOU ##R ##CE OF LIGHT CHR ##IS COULD NOT SEE HIS FACE
THE DOUB ##LE FAN ##S OF MIN ##UTE WR ##INK ##LES BREAK ##ING FROM EYE CORN ##ER TO TEM ##PLE AND JO ##INING WITH THOSE OVER THE CHE ##E ##K ##BO ##NE ##S WERE DRAW ##N INTO THE HOR ##IZ ##ONT ##AL LINE ##S ACROSS THE DO ##MED FORE ##H ##EAD
LITTLE T ##U ##FT ##S OF WHITE F ##U ##Z ##Z ABOVE THE EAR ##S WERE ALL THAT REM ##AINED OF THE AN ##T ##I ##QU ##AR ##IAN ' S HAIR BUT WHAT DREW AND HELD CHR ##IS ' S G ##AZ ##E WERE THE OLD MAN ' S EYES
CHR ##IS BL ##INK ##ED AND LOOKED AGAIN YES THEY WERE STILL THERE
CHR ##IS SW ##ALL ##OWED AND HIS VOICE CAME BACK TO HIM
YES SIR HE SAID
I SAW YOUR SIGN AND I KNOW A BOY WHO NEED ##S THE JO ##B
HE ' S A SCHOOL ##MA ##TE OF MINE
J ##AKE ##Y HAR ##RI ##S HIS NAME IS AND HE REALLY NEED ##S THE JO ##B
I I JUST WONDER ##ED IF THE PLACE WAS STILL OPEN
WHAT HE SAW WAS A FRE ##SH CHE ##E ##KED LAD T ##ALL FOR THIR ##TEEN ST ##UR ##DY WITH SINCE ##RI ##TY AND GOOD HUM ##OR IN HIS FACE AND SOMETHING SENS ##IT ##IVE AND APP ##E ##AL ##ING ABOUT HIS EYES
HE GU ##ESSED THERE MUST BE A LIVE ##LY FIRE IN THAT ROOM BEYOND
WOULD THAT INTER ##FE ##RE WITH J ##AKE ##Y ' S GETTING THE JO ##B SIR
BUT EVEN AS HE SLOWLY TURNED THE THOUGHT PIE ##R ##CED HIS MIND WHY HAD HE NOT SEEN THE REF ##LE ##CTION OF THE HEAD ##L ##IGHT ##S OF THE CAR ##S MO ##VING UP AROUND THE CORN ##ER OF WATER STREET AND UP THE HILL TOWARD THE TRA ##FF ##IC SIGN ##ALS
THE ROOM SEEMED OVER ##LY STILL
THEN IN THAT SECOND HE TURNED AND FACE ##D ABOUT
THE W ##IDE BO ##W WINDOW WAS THERE BEFORE HIM THE THREE OBJECT ##S HE LIKE ##D BEST SHOW ##ING FR ##OST ##Y IN THE MOON ##L ##IGHT THAT PO ##URED IN FROM ACROSS THE WATER
ACROSS THE WATER WHERE WAS THE FREE ##WAY
IT WAS NO LONGER THERE NOR WERE THE HIGH WALL ##S AND SM ##OKE ##ST ##ACK ##S OF FACT ##OR ##IES TO BE SEEN
THE WAR ##E ##H ##OUSE ##S WERE STILL THERE
FL ##AB ##BER ##G ##AST ##ED AND BREATH ##LESS CHR ##IS WAS UN ##AW ##ARE THAT HE HAD MOVE ##D CLOSE ##R TO PE ##ER OUT THE WINDOW IN EVERY DIRECT ##ION
NO ELE ##CT ##RIC SIGN ##S NO LA ##M ##PL ##IT STREET ##S
WHERE THE PEOPLE ' S DR ##UG ##ST ##ORE HAD STOOD BUT A HALF HOUR BEFORE ROSE THE RO ##O ##F ##S OF WHAT WAS EV ##IDENT ##LY AN INN
A COURT ##Y ##ARD WAS SP ##ARS ##EL ##Y LI ##T BY A FL ##ARING TO ##R ##CH OR TWO SHOW ##ING A SW ##ING ##ING SIGN HUNG ON A POST

THEY MOVE ##D INTO THE INN THE CO ##ACH RA ##T ##TLE ##D OFF TO THE ST ##ABLE
MY WINDOW HAS A POWER FOR THOSE FEW WHO ARE TO SEE
THE LEAR ##NING OF MAG ##IC WAS BY NO MEANS EAS ##Y
HE HAD TOLD HIS MASTER AT ONCE ABOUT SIM ##ON GO ##S ##LER HIS HOR ##DE OF MONEY AND HIS H ##ID ##ING PLACE ##S FOR IT
CHR ##IS THEREFORE THR ##EW HIMSELF INTO ALL THE PRE ##L ##IM ##IN ##AR ##IES OF HIS T ##ASK
ONE AFTER ##N ##OON WHEN HE RETURNED AFTER A REST TO MISTER W ##ICK ##ER ' S STUD ##Y HE SAW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING NEW IN THE ROOM A BO ##W ##L WITH A GOLD ##F ##ISH IN IT STOOD ON THE TABLE BUT MISTER W ##ICK ##ER WAS NOT TO BE SEEN
WHAT SHALL I DO FIRST
HOW YOU HAVE IMP ##RO ##VED MY BOY HE EXCLAIMED IT IS NOW TIME FOR YOU TO TRY AND THIS IS AS GOOD A CHANGE AS ANY
SUPPOSE I CHANGE AND CAN ' T CHANGE BACK
MISTER W ##ICK ##ER WAIT ##ED PAT ##IENT ##LY BESIDE HIM FOR A FEW MOMENT ##S FOR CHR ##IS TO GET UP HIS COUR ##AGE
THEN AS NOTHING HAPPENED WITH A VOICE LIKE A WH ##IP MISTER W ##ICK ##ER SAID START AT ONCE
THE SENS ##ATION SPR ##EAD FAST ##ER AND FAST ##ER
HIS HEAD SW ##AM AND HE FELT FA ##INT AND A LITTLE S ##ICK BUT HE PERS ##IST ##ED THROUGH THE FIN ##AL WORDS
HE THOUGHT NOT WITHOUT A FEELING OF PR ##IDE AND COMM ##ENCE ##D EXPER ##IMENT ##ING WITH HIS T ##AIL AND FIN ##S WITH SUCH ENT ##H ##US ##IA ##S ##M AND DELIGHT THAT SOME LITTLE TIME EL ##APS ##ED BEFORE MISTER W ##ICK ##ER ' S VOICE BO ##OME ##D CLOSE BY
SEVENT ##Y FOUR BOOK ONE THE RETURN
THE FIG ##URE ' S SHO ##ES CAR ##VED IN SOME EAS ##TERN ST ##Y ##LE HAD CUR ##VED UP POINT ##ING TO ##ES
THEN ALL AT ONCE THE IDEA CAME TO CHR ##IS
IF HE WAS TO BE A MAG ##IC ##IAN COULD HE MAKE THIS BOY COME TO LIFE
HE SQU ##AT ##TED ON HIS HA ##UN ##CHES EXAM ##INING THE CAR ##VED WOOD ##EN FIG ##URE ATT ##ENT ##IVE ##LY AND FELT CONV ##INCE ##D THAT ONCE AL ##IVE THE BOY WOULD BE AN IDEA ##L AND HAPPY COMPAN ##ION
BUT HOW DID ONE CHANGE IN ##AN ##IM ##ATE TO ANIM ##ATE
CHR ##IS GOT UP AND STO ##LE BACK TO MISTER W ##ICK ##ER ' S DOOR
HE HEARD THE MAG ##IC ##IAN GOING UP THE SPIR ##AL ST ##AIR ##C ##ASE TO HIS ROOM ABOVE AND AFTER CH ##ANG ##ING HIMSELF TO A MO ##USE TO SL ##IP UNDER THE DOOR AND SEE THAT THE ROOM WAS REALLY EM ##PT ##Y CHR ##IS RES ##UM ##ED HIS PROPER SH ##APE AND OPENED THE DOOR ##S OF THE C ##UP ##BO ##ARD AT THE FAR END OF THE ROOM
THE AFTER ##N ##OON RA ##IN ##Y BEFORE INC ##RE ##ASED IN STO ##R ##M
DU ##S ##K CAME TWO HOURS BEFORE ITS TIME TH ##UND ##ER SN ##AR ##LED IN THE SK ##Y
CERTAIN ELE ##MENTS WERE TO BE M ##IX ##ED AND PO ##URED AT THE PROPER TIME
MISTER W ##ICK ##ER BEGAN MO ##VING ABOUT UP ##ST ##AIRS THE FLOOR ##BO ##ARDS CRE ##AKE ##D AND STILL CHR ##IS COULD NOT LEAVE UNTIL THE PO ##T ##ION F ##UM ##ED AND GL ##OWED
WITH INF ##IN ##ITE CA ##UTION CHR ##IS CLOSE ##D THE DOOR SIL ##ENTLY BEHIND HIM AND RUN ##NING LIGHT ##LY FORWARD REACHED THE FIG ##URE OF THE NE ##GR ##O BOY
IT WAS AS IF THE ST ##IFF ##NESS ME ##LT ##ED
UNDER HIS EYES THE WOOD ##EN FO ##LD ##S OF CLOTH BECAME RICH SIL ##K EMB ##RO ##IDE ##RY GL ##E ##AMED IN ITS REAL ##ITY UPON THE CO ##AT AND OH THE FACE
THE WOOD ##EN GR ##IN LO ##OSE ##NED THE LARGE EYES TURNED THE HAND HOLD ##ING THE HARD BO ##U ##QU ##ET OF CAR ##VED FLO ##W ##ERS MOVE ##D AND LET THE BO ##U ##QU ##ET FALL
THEY WENT DOWN TO THEIR QUAR ##TERS FIRST
GU ##ESS MISTER FIN ##NEY WENT TO HIS QUAR ##TERS I DON ' T REMEMBER SEEING HIM CROSS THE DEC ##K OR COME OVER THAT WAY AT ALL
NEXT NE ##D C ##ILL ##EY WAS REL ##IE ##VED AT THE HEL ##M BY EL ##BERT JO ##NE ##S WHO TOOK OVER NE ##D WENT ON DOWN
IT LOOK ##S TO ME AS IF IT COULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF SEVERAL PEOPLE AND I ' LL BE SW ##ITCH ##ED IF I KNOW WHO I ' LL KEEP MY EYES OPEN
THE M ##IR ##AB ##ELL ##E WAS NEAR ##ING T ##AH ##IT ##I
WE ' VE WATER AND FRE ##SH STO ##RES TO TAKE ON THERE
CHR ##IS LOST NO TIME AS SOON AS HE COULD DO IT WITHOUT BEING NOT ##ICED IN HUR ##RY ##ING DOWN TO HIS CA ##B ##IN
CERTAINLY MY BOY BO ##OME ##D OUT THE CAPTAIN HIS BLUE EYES AB ##RUPT ##LY KE ##EN AND PEN ##ET ##RA ##TING
MISTER FIN ##NEY WILL BE SOME TIME ON DEC ##K WE CANNOT BE OVER ##H ##EAR ##D IN HERE
HIS FACE FR ##O ##Z ##E WITH NE ##R ##V ##OUS ##NESS THAT THIS MIGHT NOT DO AS AN ANSWER AND HE STOOD ST ##IFF AND STILL BEFORE CAPTAIN BL ##IZ ##Z ##ARD
THE CAPTAIN SAT FORWARD IN HIS CHAIR LOOKING AT HIM FOR A LONG MOMENT CONSIDER ##ING
THEN HE SAID WELL I DO NOT CARE FOR IT I CANNOT SAY I DO
THIS SHIP IS MORE TO ME THAN WIFE OR MOTHER OR FAMILY
HE PA ##USED FING ##ERING HIS LOW ##ER LI ##P AND LOOKING SIDE ##WAYS IN A REF ##LE ##CT ##IVE FA ##SH ##ION AT CHR ##IS STANDING BEFORE HIM
WE SHALL SAY NO MORE BUT I TR ##UST YOU UNDERSTAND THE RES ##P ##ONS ##IB ##ILITY YOU HAVE
THIS SHIP ITS CAR ##G ##O AND ITS MEN WILL BE IN YOUR HANDS
YES SIR I THINK I CAN DO IT SA ##FE ##LY OR I SHOULD NOT TRY SIR
CAPTAIN BL ##IZ ##Z ##ARD ' S ROUND P ##INK FACE CRE ##ASED IN HIS WIN ##NING SMILE
HE THEN WENT ON TO DES ##CRIB ##E WHAT ELSE WAS TO FOLLOW THE COVER ##ING OF THE SHIP WITH LEAVE ##S TO MAKE IT BL ##END WITH ITS SUR ##RO ##UND ##INGS
CA ##M ##OU ##F ##LA ##GE WAS NOT A WORD THE CAPTAIN OR ANY ##ONE ELSE OF HIS TIME YET UNDERST ##OOD
WHAT CAN BE SAID DURING THAT TIME SIR CHR ##IS THOUGHT TO ASK
I AM SOME ##WH ##AT SK ##ILLED IN MED ##IC ##AME ##N ##TS I HAVE TO BE AS CAPTAIN OF A SHIP AND THE CRE ##W KNOW IT
I SHALL SAY THAT YOU ARE IN MY OWN CA ##B ##IN SO THAT I CAN CARE FOR YOU
NOT SINCE HE HAD LEFT MISTER W ##ICK ##ER HAD CHR ##IS FELT SUCH CONF ##IDENCE AS HE DID IN THE WORDS AND ACT ##IONS OF CAPTAIN BL ##IZ ##Z ##ARD
HE KNEW NOW THAT HIS ABS ##ENCE FOR AS LONG AS HE HAD TO BE AWAY WOULD BE COVER ##ED UP AND SATISF ##ACT ##OR ##ILY ACCOUNT ##ED FOR
THEIR CONVERS ##ATION HAD TAKEN SOME LITTLE WHILE
WHEN CHURCH ##Y ##ARDS Y ##AW ##N
I KNEW WELL ENOUGH THAT HE MIGHT BE CARRIED THOUSAND ##S OF MILES IN THE BOX CAR LO ##CK ##ED IN PERHAPS WITHOUT WATER OR FOOD
I AM SURE I K ##ISS ##ED LI ##D ##DY AND I HAVE HAD TERRI ##BLE MOMENT ##S SINCE WHEN I SEEM TO REMEMBER K ##ISS ##ING MISTER J ##AM ##IES ##ON TOO IN THE EXC ##ITE ##MENT
FORT ##UN ##ATELY WAR ##NER AND THE DET ##ECT ##IVES WERE KEEP ##ING B ##ACH ##EL ##OR HALL IN THE LO ##D ##GE
OUT OF DEF ##ERE ##N ##CE TO LI ##D ##DY THEY WAS ##H ##ED THEIR DIS ##H ##ES ONCE A DAY AND THEY CON ##CO ##CTED QU ##EE ##R ME ##S ##SE ##S ACCORD ##ING TO THEIR SEVERAL AB ##IL ##ITIES
MISS INN ##ES HE SAID STO ##PPING ME AS I WAS ABOUT TO GO TO MY ROOM UP ST ##AIRS HOW ARE YOUR NE ##R ##VES TO ##N ##IGHT
I HAVE NONE I SAID HAPP ##ILY
I MEAN HE PERS ##IST ##ED DO YOU FEEL AS THOUGH YOU COULD GO THROUGH WITH SOMETHING RATHER UN ##US ##UAL
THE MOST UN ##US ##UAL THING I CAN THINK OF WOULD BE A PEACE ##FUL NIGHT
SOMETHING IS GOING TO OCC ##UR HE SAID
PUT ON HEAVY SHO ##ES AND SOME OLD DARK CLOTH ##ES AND MAKE UP YOUR MIND NOT TO BE SURPR ##ISED AT ANYTHING
LI ##D ##DY WAS SLEEP ##ING THE SLEEP OF THE JUST WHEN I WENT UP ST ##AIRS AND I H ##UNT ##ED OUT MY THINGS CA ##UT ##IOUSLY
THEY WERE TALK ##ING CONF ##IDENT ##IAL ##LY TOGETHER BUT WHEN I CAME DOWN THEY CE ##ASED
THERE WERE A FEW PREP ##AR ##ATIONS TO BE MADE THE LO ##CK ##S TO BE GONE OVER WIN ##TERS TO BE INST ##RU ##CTED AS TO RE ##NE ##W ##ED VI ##G ##IL ##ANCE AND THEN AFTER EXT ##ING ##U ##ISH ##ING THE HALL LIGHT WE CRE ##PT IN THE DARK ##NESS THROUGH THE FRONT DOOR AND INTO THE NIGHT
I ASKED NO QUESTION ##S
ONCE ONLY SOME ##BODY SPOKE AND THEN IT WAS AN EM ##PH ##AT ##IC BIT OF PROF ##AN ##ITY FROM DOCTOR STE ##W ##ART WHEN HE RAN INTO A W ##IRE FE ##N ##CE
I HARDLY KNOW WHAT I EXPECT ##ED
THE DOCTOR WAS P ##UFF ##ING SOME ##WH ##AT WHEN WE FIN ##ALLY CAME TO A HA ##LT
I CONF ##ESS THAT JUST AT THAT MIN ##UTE EVEN SUN ##NY ##SIDE SEEMED A CHE ##ER ##FUL SP ##OT
IN SP ##ITE OF MYSELF I DREW MY BREATH IN SHAR ##PLY
IT WAS AL ##E ##X ARM ##ED WITH TWO LONG HAND ##LED SP ##ADE ##S
THE DOCTOR KEPT A KE ##EN LOOK ##OUT BUT NO ONE APPEARED
THERE ' S ONE THING SURE I ' LL NOT BE SUS ##PECT ##ED OF COMP ##LIC ##ITY
A DOCTOR IS GENERAL ##LY SUPPOSE ##D TO BE HAND ##IER AT BUR ##YING FO ##L ##KS THAN AT D ##IG ##GING THEM UP
I HELD ON TO HIM FR ##ANT ##ICALLY AND SOME ##H ##OW I GOT THERE AND LOOKED DOWN
BUT HOW AM I TO GET OVER THE TEN OR TW ##ELVE DAYS THAT MUST YET EL ##APS ##E BEFORE THEY GO
FOR NONE COULD IN ##J ##URE ME AS HE HAS DONE OH
THE WORD ST ##ARE ##S ME IN THE FACE LIKE A GU ##ILT ##Y CONF ##ESSION BUT IT IS TRUE I HAT ##E HIM I HAT ##E HIM
I SOMETIMES THINK I OUGHT TO GIVE HIM CRE ##D ##IT FOR THE GOOD FEELING HE SIM ##UL ##ATES SO WELL AND THEN AGAIN I THINK IT IS MY DUT ##Y TO SUS ##PECT HIM UNDER THE PE ##CUL ##IAR CIRCUMST ##ANCES IN WHICH I AM PLACED
I HAVE DONE WELL TO RECO ##R ##D THEM SO MIN ##UTE ##LY
THEY HAD BET ##AKEN THEMSELVES TO THEIR WORK I LESS TO DIV ##ERT MY MIND THAN TO DEP ##RE ##C ##ATE CONVERS ##ATION HAD PROV ##IDED MYSELF WITH A BOOK
I AM TOO WELL ACQU ##AINT ##ED WITH YOUR CHARACTER AND COND ##UCT TO FEEL ANY REAL FRIENDS ##H ##IP FOR YOU AND AS I AM WITHOUT YOUR T ##ALE ##N ##T FOR DIS ##S ##IM ##UL ##ATION I CANNOT ASS ##UM ##E THE APPEAR ##ANCE OF IT

THEY ' RE PROP ##RIE ##TO ##R ##S OF A SORT BUT WE ' RE THE LAND ##OWN ##ERS

MOST PEOPLE CL ##ING TO THE SUPER ##N ##AT ##UR ##AL
IF THEY GIVE UP ONE GOD THEY IMAG ##INE ANOTHER
WHAT IS THIS POWER
MAN ADV ##ANCES AND NECESS ##AR ##ILY ADV ##ANCES THROUGH EXPER ##IENCE
A MAN WISH ##ING TO GO TO A CERTAIN PLACE COMES TO WHERE THE ROAD DIV ##IDES
HE HAS TRIED THAT ROAD AND KNOW ##S THAT IT IS THE WRONG ROAD
A CHILD CHAR ##MED BY THE BEAUTY OF THE FL ##AME GRA ##S ##PS IT WITH ITS D ##IM ##PLE ##D HAND
THE POWER THAT WORK ##S FOR RIGHT ##E ##OUS ##NESS HAS T ##AUGHT THE CHILD A LESS ##ON
IT IS A RES ##ULT
IT IS INS ##IST ##ED BY THESE THE ##OL ##OG ##IANS AND BY MANY OF THE SO CALLED PHIL ##OS ##OP ##HER ##S THAT THIS MOR ##AL SENSE THIS SENSE OF DUT ##Y OF OBL ##IG ##ATION WAS IMPORT ##ED AND THAT CONS ##CI ##ENCE IS AN EX ##OT ##IC
WE LIVE TOGETHER IN FAM ##IL ##IES TRI ##BE ##S AND NAT ##IONS
THEY ARE PR ##A ##ISED ADM ##IRED AND RESPECT ##ED
THEY ARE REGARD ##ED AS GOOD THAT IS TO SAY AS MOR ##AL
THE MEM ##BER ##S WHO ADD TO THE MIS ##ERY OF THE FAMILY THE TRI ##BE OR THE NAT ##ION ARE CONSIDER ##ED BAD MEM ##BER ##S
THE GREAT ##EST OF HUMAN BEING ##S HAS SAID CONS ##CI ##ENCE IS BORN OF LOVE
AS PEOPLE ADV ##ANCE THE REM ##OTE CONSE ##QU ##ENCES ARE PER ##CEIVED
THE IMAG ##INATION IS C ##ULT ##IV ##ATED
A MAN PUT ##S HIMSELF IN THE PLACE OF ANOTHER
THE SENSE OF DUT ##Y BECOME ##S STRONG ##ER MORE IMP ##ER ##ATIVE
MAN JUD ##GE ##S HIMSELF
IN ALL THIS THERE IS NOTHING SUPER ##N ##AT ##UR ##AL
MAN HAS DEC ##E ##IVE ##D HIMSELF
HAS CHRIST ##IAN ##ITY DONE GOOD
WHEN THE CHURCH HAD CONTR ##OL WERE MEN MADE BETTER AND HAPP ##IER
WHAT HAS REL ##IG ##ION DONE FOR HUNG ##ARY OR A ##UST ##RI ##A
COULD THESE COUNT ##RIE ##S HAVE BEEN WOR ##SE WITHOUT REL ##IG ##ION
COULD THEY HAVE BEEN WOR ##SE HAD THEY HAD ANY OTHER REL ##IG ##ION THAN CHRIST ##IAN ##ITY
WHAT DID CHRIST ##IAN ##ITY DO FOR THEM
THEY HAT ##ED PLEASURE
THEY MU ##FF ##LED ALL THE BELL ##S OF GLAD ##NESS
THE REL ##IG ##ION OF THE PUR ##IT ##AN WAS AN UN ##AD ##ULT ##ER ##ATED CUR ##SE
THE PUR ##IT ##AN BELIEVE ##D THE B ##IBLE TO BE THE WORD OF GOD AND THIS BELIE ##F HAS ALWAYS MADE THOSE WHO HELD IT CR ##UE ##L AND WR ##ET ##CHED
LET ME REF ##ER TO JUST ONE FACT SHOW ##ING THE INFL ##UE ##N ##CE OF A BELIE ##F IN THE B ##IBLE ON HUMAN BEING ##S
THE QUEEN RECEIVED THE B ##IBLE K ##ISS ##ED IT AND PLE ##D ##GED HERSELF TO D ##IL ##IG ##ENTLY READ THERE ##IN
IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS JUST AS F ##IEND ##ISH JUST AS INF ##AM ##OUS AS THE CAT ##H ##OL ##IC SPIRIT
HAS THE B ##IBLE MADE THE PEOPLE OF GE ##OR ##G ##IA KIND AND MER ##CI ##FUL
REL ##IG ##ION HAS BEEN TRIED AND IN ALL COUNT ##RIE ##S IN ALL TIMES HAS FA ##ILED
REL ##IG ##ION HAS ALWAYS BEEN THE ENEM ##Y OF SC ##IENCE OF INV ##EST ##IG ##ATION AND THOUGHT
REL ##IG ##ION HAS NEVER MADE MAN FREE
IT HAS NEVER MADE MAN MOR ##AL TEM ##PER ##ATE IND ##UST ##RI ##OUS AND HON ##EST
ARE CHRIST ##IANS MORE TEM ##PER ##ATE NEAR ##ER VI ##R ##T ##U ##OUS NEAR ##ER HON ##EST THAN SA ##V ##AGES
CAN WE CUR ##E DIS ##E ##ASE BY SUPP ##LIC ##ATION
CAN WE REC ##E ##IVE VI ##R ##T ##UE OR HON ##OR AS AL ##MS
REL ##IG ##ION REST ##S ON THE IDEA THAT NATURE HAS A MASTER AND THAT THIS MASTER WILL LIST ##EN TO PRAY ##ER THAT THIS MASTER P ##UN ##ISH ##ES AND RE ##WARDS THAT HE LOVE ##S PR ##A ##ISE AND FL ##ATTER ##Y AND HAT ##ES THE BRA ##VE AND FREE
WE MUST HAVE CORN ##ER STONE ##S
THE STR ##UCT ##URE MUST HAVE A B ##ASE ##MENT
IF WE BUILD WE MUST BEGIN AT THE BO ##T ##TO ##M
I HAVE A THE ##ORY AND I HAVE FOUR CORN ##ER STONE ##S
THE FIRST STONE IS THAT MATTER SUB ##ST ##ANCE CANNOT BE DEST ##RO ##Y ##ED CANNOT BE ANN ##I ##H ##IL ##ATED
IF THESE CORN ##ER STONE ##S ARE FACT ##S IT FOLLOW ##S AS A NECESS ##ITY THAT MATTER AND FORCE ARE FROM AND TO E ##TERN ##ITY THAT THEY CAN NEITHER BE INC ##RE ##ASED NOR D ##IM ##IN ##ISHED
IT FOLLOW ##S THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN OR CAN BE CREAT ##ED THAT THERE NEVER HAS BEEN OR CAN BE A CREAT ##OR
IT FOLLOW ##S THAT THERE COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ANY INTELL ##IG ##ENCE ANY DES ##IGN BACK OF MATTER AND FORCE
I SAY WHAT I THINK
EVERY EVEN ##T HAS PAR ##ENTS
THAT WHICH HAS NOT HAPPENED COULD NOT
IN THE INF ##IN ##ITE CH ##AIN THERE IS AND THERE CAN BE NO BR ##OKEN NO MISS ##ING LI ##N ##K
WE NOW KNOW THAT OUR FIRST PAR ##ENTS WERE NOT FORE ##IGN ##ERS
WE NOW KNOW IF WE KNOW ANYTHING THAT THE UN ##IVER ##SE IS NATURAL AND THAT MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN NATURAL ##LY PRODU ##CED
WE KNOW THE PAT ##H ##S THAT LIFE HAS TRA ##VEL ##ED
WE KNOW THE FOOT ##ST ##EP ##S OF ADV ##ANCE THEY HAVE BEEN TRA ##CED
FOR THOUSAND ##S OF YEARS MEN AND WOMEN HAVE BEEN TRY ##ING TO REF ##ORM THE WORLD
WHY HAVE THE REF ##ORM ##ERS FA ##ILED
THEY DEP ##END ON THE LORD ON LU ##CK AND CHAR ##ITY
THEY LIVE BY FR ##AU ##D AND VI ##OL ##ENCE AND BE ##QU ##E ##ATH THEIR VI ##CES TO THEIR CHILDREN
FA ##IL ##URE SEEMS TO BE THE TRA ##DE ##MA ##R ##K OF NATURE WHY
NATURE PRODU ##CES WITHOUT PURPOSE SUS ##TAIN ##S WITHOUT INT ##ENTION AND DEST ##RO ##YS WITHOUT THOUGHT
MUST THE WORLD FORE ##VER REM ##AIN THE VICT ##IM OF I ##GN ##OR ##ANT PASS ##ION
WHY SHOULD MEN AND WOMEN HAVE CHILDREN THAT THEY CANNOT TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN THAT ARE BUR ##DEN ##S AND CUR ##SE ##S WHY
PASS ##ION IS AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN DE ##A ##F
LAW CAN P ##UN ##ISH BUT IT CAN NEITHER REF ##ORM CR ##IM ##IN ##ALS NOR PRE ##VENT CR ##IME
THIS CANNOT BE DONE BY TALK OR EXAM ##PLE
THIS IS THE SOL ##UTION OF THE WHOLE QUESTION
THIS FREE ##S WOMAN
PO ##VER ##TY AND CR ##IME WILL BE CHILD ##LESS
IT IS FAR BETTER TO BE FREE TO LEAVE THE FORT ##S AND BAR ##RIC ##ADE ##S OF FEAR TO STAND ER ##ECT AND FACE THE F ##UT ##URE WITH A SMILE

IF IT HAD BEEN POSSIBLE TO SEND MISSUS RAN ##SO ##M MONEY OR EVEN CLOTH ##ES SHE WOULD HAVE LIKE ##D THAT BUT SHE HAD NO MEANS OF AS ##CER ##TAIN ##ING HOW SUCH AN OFF ##ERING WOULD BE TAKEN
O ##L ##IVE HAD A FEAR OF EVERYTHING BUT HER GREAT ##EST FEAR WAS OF BEING AFRAID
SHE HAD ER ##ECT ##ED IT INTO A SORT OF RU ##LE OF COND ##UCT THAT WHEN ##EVER SHE SAW A R ##IS ##K SHE WAS TO TAKE IT AND SHE HAD FRE ##QU ##ENT HUM ##IL ##IA ##T ##IONS AT FIND ##ING HERSELF SA ##FE AFTER ALL
SHE WAS PERFECT ##LY SA ##FE AFTER WR ##ITING TO B ##AS ##IL RAN ##SO ##M AND INDEED IT WAS DIFFIC ##ULT TO SEE WHAT HE COULD HAVE DONE TO HER EXCEPT THAN ##K HER HE WAS ONLY EXCEPT ##ION ##ALLY SUPER ##LA ##T ##IVE FOR HER LETTER AND ASS ##URE HER THAT HE WOULD COME AND SEE HER THE FIRST TIME HIS BUSINESS HE WAS BEGIN ##NING TO GET A LITTLE SHOULD TAKE HIM TO BO ##ST ##ON
HE WAS TOO SIM ##PLE TOO MISS ##ISS ##IP ##P ##IAN FOR THAT SHE WAS ALMOST DISAPP ##OINT ##ED
OF ALL THINGS IN THE WORLD CONT ##ENTION WAS MOST SWEET TO HER THOUGH WHY IT IS HARD TO IMAG ##INE FOR IT ALWAYS CO ##ST HER TEARS HEAD ##ACH ##ES A DAY OR TWO IN BED AC ##UTE EM ##OT ##ION AND IT WAS VERY POSSIBLE B ##AS ##IL RAN ##SO ##M WOULD NOT CARE TO CONT ##END
MISS CHANCE ##LL ##OR HERSELF HAD THOUGHT SO MUCH ON THE VI ##T ##AL SUBJECT WOULD NOT SHE MAKE A FEW REMARK ##S AND GIVE THEM SOME OF HER EXPER ##IENCE ##S
HOW DID THE LAD ##IES ON BE ##AC ##ON STREET FEEL ABOUT THE B ##ALL ##OT
PERHAPS SHE COULD SPEAK FOR THEM MORE THAN FOR SOME OTHERS
WITH HER IM ##MEN ##SE SY ##M ##P ##ATH ##Y FOR REF ##ORM SHE FOUND HERSELF SO OFTEN WISH ##ING THAT REF ##ORM ##ERS WERE A LITTLE DIFFERENT
O ##L ##IVE HAT ##ED TO HEAR THAT FINE AV ##EN ##UE TALK ##ED ABOUT AS IF IT WERE SUCH A REMARK ##ABLE PLACE AND TO LIVE THERE WERE A PRO ##O ##F OF WORLD ##LY GL ##ORY
ALL SORT ##S OF INF ##ER ##IOR PEOPLE LIVED THERE AND SO BR ##ILL ##IAN ##T A WOMAN AS MISSUS FAR ##RI ##NDER WHO LIVED AT RO ##X ##B ##URY OUGHT NOT TO M ##IX THINGS UP
SHE KNEW HER PLACE IN THE BO ##ST ##ON H ##IER ##AR ##CH ##Y AND IT WAS NOT WHAT MISSUS FAR ##RI ##NDER SUPPOSE ##D SO THAT THERE WAS A WANT OF PERS ##PECT ##IVE IN TALK ##ING TO HER AS IF SHE HAD BEEN A REP ##RES ##ENT ##ATIVE OF THE AR ##IST ##OC ##RA ##CY
SHE WISH ##ED TO WORK IN ANOTHER FIELD SHE HAD LONG BEEN PRE ##OC ##C ##UP ##IED WITH THE ROM ##ANCE OF THE PEOPLE
THIS MIGHT SEEM ONE OF THE MOST ACC ##ESS ##IBLE OF PLEASURE ##S BUT IN POINT OF FACT SHE HAD NOT FOUND IT SO
CHAR ##L ##IE WAS A YOUNG MAN IN A WHITE OVER ##CO ##AT AND A PAPER COLL ##AR IT WAS FOR HIM IN THE LAST AN ##AL ##YS ##IS THAT THEY CARE ##D MUCH THE MOST
O ##L ##IVE CHANCE ##LL ##OR WONDER ##ED HOW MISSUS FAR ##RI ##NDER WOULD TREAT THAT BRA ##N ##CH OF THE QUESTION
IF IT BE NECESSARY WE ARE PREP ##ARED TO TAKE CERTAIN STEP ##S TO CON ##CI ##L ##IA ##TE THE SH ##RI ##N ##KING
OUR MOVE ##MENT IS FOR ALL IT APP ##E ##ALS TO THE MOST DEL ##IC ##ATE LAD ##IES

IT WAS ONE THING TO CH ##OOSE FOR HERSELF BUT NOW THE GREAT REP ##RES ##ENT ##ATIVE OF THE EN ##F ##RA ##N ##CH ##ISE ##MENT OF THEIR SE ##X FROM EVERY FORM OF BO ##ND ##AGE HAD CH ##OSE ##N FOR HER
THE UN ##H ##APP ##INESS OF WOMEN

IT WAS NOT CLEAR TO THIS INTEREST ##ING GIRL IN WHAT MANNER SUCH A SA ##CRI ##F ##ICE AS THIS LAST WOULD BE REQU ##IRED OF HER BUT SHE SAW THE MATTER THROUGH A KIND OF SUN ##RI ##SE MIST OF EM ##OT ##ION WHICH MADE DANGER AS RO ##S ##Y AS SUCCESS

AT BEST HE WOULD GET OFF WITH A SC ##OT ##CH VER ##D ##ICT OF NOT PROV ##EN BUT HE DOES ##N ' T WANT THAT NOR DO I
AND YOU I DON ' T WANT IT EITHER
BUT I WANT TO KNOW JUST WHERE WE STAND NOW I KNOW

CH ##UCK ##LED THE COL ##ONE ##L AS HE SK ##IL ##FULLY PLAY ##ED THE LU ##CK ##LESS TR ##OUT NOW STR ##UGG ##LING TO GET LO ##OSE FROM THE HO ##OK
AND WHEN THE FISH WAS LAND ##ED PA ##N ##TING ON THE GRA ##S ##S AND SH ##AG HAD BEEN RO ##USED FROM HIS SL ##UMB ##ER TO SL ##IP THE NOW LIM ##P FISH INTO THE CRE ##EL COL ##ONE ##L AS ##H ##LEY GAVE A S ##IGH OF REL ##IEF AND REMARK ##ED I THINK I SEE IT NOW
THE REASON SHE ASKED NO AL ##IM ##ONY INQU ##IRED KE ##N ##NE ##TH
NO I WAS ##N ' T THINKING OF THAT
HOWEVER DON ' T THINK I ' M NOT INTEREST ##ED IN YOUR CASE I ' VE FISH ##ED ENOUGH FOR TO DAY
WELL I DON ' T KNOW THAT YOU CAN
IT IS ##N ' T GENERAL ##LY KNOWN WENT ON THE LAW ##Y ##ER THAT THE HOT ##EL KEEP ##ER ' S WIFE HAS LEFT HIM
IT WAS ONE OF WHAT AT FIRST MIGHT BE CALLED REF ##INED CR ##UE ##LT ##Y ON HER HUSBAND ' S PART DE ##GE ##NER ##ATING GRA ##DU ##ALLY INTO THAT OF THE B ##ASE ##R SORT
YOU DON ' T MEAN THAT LAR ##CH STRUCK HER THAT THERE WAS PH ##YS ##ICAL AB ##USE DO YOU ASKED THE COL ##ONE ##L THAT ' S WHAT HE DID
THE COL ##ONE ##L DID NOT DISC ##L ##OSE THE FACT THAT IT WAS NO NEWS TO HIM
A ##AR ##ON GRA ##FT ##ON ' S STATE ##MENT WAS BEING UN ##E ##X ##PECT ##ED ##LY CONF ##IR ##MED
HE REMEMBER ##ED THAT C ##Y ##N ##TH ##IA AND GRA ##FT ##ON HAD ONCE BEEN IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER
SHE SAID HE HAD STRUCK HER MORE THAN ONCE AND SHE COULD STAND IT NO LONGER
BECAUSE LAR ##CH MADE NO DEF ##ENSE
LAR ##CH BY REF ##US ##ING TO APPEAR PRACT ##ICALLY ADM ##ITTED THE CHAR ##GE ##S AGAINST HIM AND DID NOT OPP ##OSE THE SE ##PAR ##ATION
SO I HAD TO LET HER HAVE HER WAY AND WE DID NOT ASK THE COURT FOR MONEY THOUGH I HAD NO SUCH SQU ##E ##AM ##ISH FEELING ##S WHEN IT CAME TO MY COUN ##SEL FE ##E
NO BUT HE WILL OR I ' LL SU ##E HIM AND GET JUD ##G ##MENT OH HE ' LL PAY ALL RIGHT
AND IT TAKE ##S ALL SORT ##S OF PERSON ##S TO MAKE IT UP
STILL I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
THE MUR ##DER OF MISSUS DA ##R ##CY HAD SOME TIME AGO BEEN SH ##IFT ##ED OFF THE FRONT PA ##GE THOUGH IT WOULD GET BACK THERE WHEN THE YOUNG JE ##W ##EL ##ER WAS TRIED
IT HAD A DOUB ##LE REP ##UT ##ATION SO TO SPEAK
GRA ##VE AND EVEN REV ##ERE ##ND CONV ##ENTION ##S ASS ##EM ##BLE ##D IN ITS B ##ALL ##RO ##OM AND POL ##IT ##IC ##IANS OF THE UP ##PER IF NOT BETTER CLASS WERE FRE ##QU ##ENTLY SEEN IN ITS DIN ##ING ROOM OR CA ##FE
LAR ##CH HIMSELF WAS A PE ##CUL ##IAR CHARACTER
IN A SMALL ##ER PLACE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED A SAL ##OON KEEP ##ER
AND IT WAS THIS MAN RICH IT WAS SAID HANDS ##OME CERTAINLY THAT C ##Y ##N ##TH ##IA RA ##T ##CH ##F ##ORD HAD MAR ##RIED
TO THIS WAS THE ANSWER WHIS ##PER ##ED MONEY
AND IN A WAY IT WAS TRUE
SHE ALSO SAW AN OPP ##ORT ##UN ##ITY OF PAY ##ING OLD DE ##B ##TS AND RE ##AP ##ING SOME REV ##ENG ##ES
AFTER THE MAR ##RIAGE WHICH WAS A BR ##ILL ##IAN ##T AND G ##AY ONE IF NOT HAPPY THE LAR ##CH HOT ##EL IT COULD HARDLY BE CALLED A HOME BECAME THE SC ##ENE OF MANY FE ##ST ##IVE OCCASION ##S
THEN IT WAS SAID OF LAR ##CH THAT SOON AFTER THE E ##CH ##O ##ES OF THE WE ##D ##D ##ING CH ##IMES HAD DIED AWAY HE HAD BEG ##UN TO TREAT HIS WIFE WITH REF ##INED CR ##UE ##LT ##Y THAT H ##ID ##DEN AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC UNDER ##NE ##ATH HIS HA ##BIT ##UAL MANNER THERE WAS THE RA ##WN ##ESS OF THE BR ##UTE
BUT IT WAS NOT ##ICED THAT THE OLD ##ER AND MORE CONSE ##R ##V ##ATIVE FAM ##IL ##IES WERE LESS OFTEN REP ##RES ##ENTED AND WHEN THEY WERE IT WAS BY SOME OF THE YOUNG ##ER MEM ##BER ##S WHOSE REP ##UT ##ATIONS WERE ALREADY SM ##IRC ##H ##ED OR WHO HAD NOT YET ACQU ##IRED ANY AND WERE WILL ##ING TO TAKE A CHANCE
IT WOULD ##N ' T DO YOU KNOW AFTER THAT STORY CAME OUT FOR ME AND THE VI ##CE CHANCE ##LL ##OR WHO SAT IN THE CASE AS WELL AS OTHER JUD ##GE ##S AND MEM ##BER ##S OF THE BAR TO BE SEEN THERE KE ##N ##NE ##TH EXPL ##AINED TO THE COL ##ONE ##L
