AS I APPROACH ##ED THE CITY I HEARD BELL ##S R ##ING ##ING AND A LITTLE LATER I FOUND THE STREET ##S AST ##IR WITH THR ##ONG ##S OF WELL DRESS ##ED PEOPLE IN FAMILY GR ##OU ##PS WE ##ND ##ING THEIR WAY H ##ITHER AND TH ##ITHER
LOOKING ABOUT ME I SAW A GENTLEMAN IN A NE ##AT BLACK DRESS SM ##ILING AND HIS HAND EXT ##END ##ED TO ME WITH GREAT COR ##D ##IAL ##ITY
HE MUST HAVE REAL ##IZED I WAS A STRANGE ##R AND WISH ##ED TO TEN ##DER HIS HO ##S ##P ##IT ##ALITY TO ME I ACCEPT ##ED IT GRA ##TE ##FULLY I CL ##ASP ##ED HIS HAND HE PRES ##SE ##D MINE
WE G ##AZ ##ED FOR A MOMENT SIL ##ENTLY INTO EACH OTHER ' S EYES
OF COURSE YOU ARE GOING THERE TOO I SAID TO MY FRIEND ##LY GU ##IDE
YES HE ANSWERED I COND ##UCT THE WOR ##SHIP I AM A PR ##IEST
AN I ##D ##OL I WHIS ##PER ##ED TAKEN BY SURPR ##ISE
THEY WOR ##SHIP ##PE ##D GOD ##S THAT DID NOT EXIST
BUT THE GRE ##E ##KS LOVED THEIR GOD ##S I PROT ##ESTED MY HEART CL ##AM ##OR ##ING IN MY BRE ##AST
NO I SAID IN A LOW VOICE
HE WAS AN I ##D ##OL THEN AND NOT A GOD
IT MADE AT ##H ##ENS A CITY OF LIGHT IT CREAT ##ED THE BEAUTIFUL THE TRUE THE GOOD YES OUR REL ##IG ##ION WAS DIV ##INE
IT HAD ONLY ONE FA ##ULT INTER ##RUPT ##ED MY GU ##IDE WHAT WAS THAT
I INQU ##IRED WITHOUT KNOW ##ING WHAT HIS ANSWER WOULD BE IT WAS NOT TRUE
PRODU ##CE HIM
I WHIS ##PER ##ED TO MYSELF WHAT BLA ##S ##PH ##EM ##Y
THEN TAKING HEART I TOLD MY GU ##IDE HOW MORE THAN ONCE I HAD FELT AP ##OL ##L ##O ' S RA ##D ##IAN ##T PRES ##ENCE IN MY HEART AND TOLD HIM OF THE IM ##M ##ORT ##AL LINE ##S OF HOME ##R CONCER ##NING THE DIV ##INE AP ##OL ##L ##O
DO YOU DOUBT HOME ##R
I SAID TO HIM HOME ##R THE INS ##P ##IRED BAR ##D
NO NO AP ##OL ##L ##O IS NOT AN I ##D ##OL
HE IS A GOD AND THE SON OF A GOD
THE AIR WAS HEAVY WITH INC ##ENSE A NUMBER OF MEN IN GO ##R ##GE ##OUS VE ##ST ##MENTS WERE PASS ##ING TO AND FR ##O BO ##W ##ING AND KN ##EE ##LING BEFORE THE VAR ##IOUS LIGHT ##S AND IMAG ##ES
OBSER ##VING MY ANX ##IET ##Y TO UNDERSTAND THE MEAN ##ING OF ALL THIS MY GU ##IDE TOOK ME AS ##IDE AND IN A WHIS ##PER TOLD ME THAT THE PEOPLE WERE CE ##LE ##BR ##ATING THE ANN ##IVER ##S ##ARY OF THE B ##IRT ##H ##DAY OF THEIR BEAUTIFUL SA ##V ##IOR JE ##S ##US THE SON OF GOD
FORG ##ET AP ##OL ##L ##O HE SAID WITH A SUGG ##EST ##ION OF SEVER ##ITY IN HIS VOICE
THERE IS NO SUCH PERSON HE WAS ONLY AN I ##D ##OL
IF YOU WERE TO SEA ##R ##CH FOR AP ##OL ##L ##O IN ALL THE UN ##IVER ##SE YOU WOULD NEVER FIND ANY ONE ANSWER ##ING TO HIS NAME OR DES ##CRI ##PT ##ION
I WANT TO SEE JE ##S ##US I HAST ##ENED TURN ##ING TOWARD HIM
WILL HE NOT BE HERE THIS MORNING
WILL HE NOT SPEAK TO HIS WOR ##SHIP ##PER ##S I ASKED AGAIN
WILL HE NOT PER ##M ##IT THEM TO TOU ##CH HIM TO CARE ##S ##S HIS HAND TO CL ##ASP HIS DIV ##INE FEET TO IN ##H ##ALE THE AM ##BR ##OS ##IAL FR ##AG ##RA ##N ##CE OF HIS BREATH TO B ##ASK IN THE GOLD ##EN LIGHT OF HIS EYES TO HEAR THE MUS ##IC OF HIS IM ##MA ##CUL ##ATE ACC ##ENTS
I ASKED MY EYES FILLED WITH WONDER AND MY VOICE QU ##IVER ##ING WITH EXC ##ITE ##MENT
WOULD NOT THAT THEN I VE ##N ##T ##URED TO ASK IMP ##AT ##IENT ##LY MAKE JE ##S ##US AS MUCH OF AN I ##D ##OL AS AP ##OL ##L ##O
AND IF FAITH THAT JE ##S ##US IS A GOD PROV ##ES HIM A GOD WHY WILL NOT FAITH IN AP ##OL ##L ##O MAKE HIM A GOD
BUT I AM DETERM ##INED NOT ONLY TO KNOW IF IT IS POSSIBLE THE WHOLE TRUTH ABOUT JE ##S ##US BUT ALSO TO COMM ##UN ##IC ##ATE THAT TRUTH TO OTHERS
BUT THERE IS MORE OF A MOR ##AL TO ##N ##IC IN THE OPEN AND CAN ##D ##ID DISC ##USS ##ION OF A SUBJECT LIKE THE ONE IN HAND THAN IN A MU ##LT ##ITUDE OF PLA ##T ##ITUDE ##S
I NEVER DEL ##IVER A LE ##CT ##URE IN WHICH I DO NOT EITHER DIRECT ##LY OR IND ##IRE ##CT ##LY GIVE FULL AND FREE EXPRESS ##ION TO MY FAITH IN EVERYTHING THAT IS WORTH ##Y OF FAITH
IF I DO NOT BELIEVE IN DOG ##MA IT IS BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN FREE ##D ##OM
OH HE TEARS DOWN BUT DOES NOT BUILD UP IS ANOTHER CR ##IT ##IC ##ISM ABOUT MY WORK IT IS NOT TRUE
NO PRE ##ACH ##ER OR PR ##IEST IS MORE CONST ##RU ##CT ##IVE
CL ##APP ##ING TRUTH INTO J ##AIL G ##AG ##GING THE MOUTH OF THE STUD ##ENT IS THAT BUILD ##ING UP OR TEAR ##ING DOWN
WHEN BR ##UN ##O LIGHT ##ED A NEW TO ##R ##CH TO INC ##RE ##ASE THE LIGHT OF THE WORLD WHAT WAS HIS RE ##WARD THE ST ##AKE
COUNT YOUR RIGHT ##S POL ##IT ##ICAL REL ##IG ##IOUS SOCI ##AL INTELL ##ECT ##UAL AND TELL ME WHICH OF THEM WAS CON ##QU ##ERED FOR YOU BY THE PR ##IEST
I WISH TO TELL YOU SOMETHING

THE MIND CRA ##VES FOR KNOWLEDGE THE CHILD ASK ##S QUESTION ##S BECAUSE OF AN IN ##BO ##R ##N DESIRE TO KNOW

WITH THIS MY ##TH ##US THE PR ##IM ##IT ##IVE MAN WAS SATISF ##IED UNTIL HIS DEV ##EL ##OP ##ING INTELL ##IG ##ENCE REAL ##IZED ITS IN ##ADE ##QU ##AC ##Y SC ##IENCE WAS BORN OF THAT REAL ##IZ ##ATION

IS JE ##S ##US A MY ##TH
THERE IS IN MAN A FA ##CUL ##TY FOR F ##ICT ##ION
IT THINK ##S LESS THAN IT GU ##ESS ##ES
IT IS REF ##LE ##CTION WHICH INT ##RO ##DU ##CES A BIT INTO THE MOUTH OF IMAG ##INATION CUR ##B ##ING ITS PA ##CE AND SUB ##DU ##ING ITS REST ##LESS SPIRIT

WE CO ##VE ##T THE RA ##IN ##BO ##W WE REACH OUT FOR THE MOON
OUR FEET DO NOT REALLY BEGIN TO TOU ##CH THE FIR ##M GROUND UNTIL WE HAVE REACHED THE YEARS OF DISC ##RET ##ION
SC ##IENCE WAS NOT BORN UNTIL MAN HAD MAT ##URED
GR ##OWN UP PEOPLE CREAT ##E SC ##IENCE
THE CRA ##DLE IS THE WOM ##B OF ALL THE FAIR ##IES AND FAITH ##S OF MAN ##K ##IND
THE SCHOOL IS THE B ##IRT ##H ##PL ##ACE OF SC ##IENCE

IN THE DISC ##USS ##ION OF THIS SUBJECT I APP ##E ##AL TO THE MAT ##URE NOT TO THE CHILD MIND
HE IS GOD ' S MOUTH ##P ##IE ##CE AND NO ONE MAY DIS ##AG ##REE WITH HIM
THE ONLY WAY I MAY COMMAND YOUR RESPECT IS TO BE REASON ##ABLE
LET US PLACE OUR ##SELVES ENTIRE ##LY IN THE HANDS OF THE EV ##IDENCE
AS INTELL ##IG ##ENT BEING ##S WE DESIRE TO KNOW WHETHER THIS JE ##S ##US WHOSE WOR ##SHIP IS NOT ONLY CO ##ST ##ING THE WORLD MILL ##IONS OF THE PEOPLE ' S MONEY BUT WHICH IS ALSO DRAW ##ING TO HIS SERV ##ICE THE TIME THE EN ##ER ##G ##IES THE AFF ##ECT ##ION THE DEV ##OT ##ION AND THE LAB ##OR OF HUMAN ##ITY IS A MY ##TH OR A REAL ##ITY
A NUMBER OF OTHER DA ##TE ##S WERE OBSER ##VED BY THE CHRIST ##IAN CHURCH AT VAR ##IOUS TIMES AS THE B ##IRT ##H ##DAY OF JE ##S ##US THE GO ##S ##PE ##LS GIVE NO DA ##TE AND APPEAR TO BE QUITE UNC ##ERTAIN REALLY I ##GN ##OR ##ANT ABOUT IT
YET THERE IS NO EV ##IDENCE THAT HE WAS BORN ON THAT DAY
WHY THIS DISC ##RE ##P ##AN ##CY IN A HIST ##OR ##ICAL DO ##C ##UM ##ENT TO SAY NOTHING ABOUT INS ##P ##IR ##ATION
AGAIN MAT ##TH ##EW SAYS THAT TO ESC ##APE THE EV ##IL DES ##IGN ##S OF HER ##OD MARY AND JO ##SE ##PH WITH THE INF ##ANT JE ##S ##US FLE ##D INTO E ##GY ##PT LU ##KE SAYS NOTHING ABOUT THIS HUR ##RIED FL ##IGHT NOR OF HER ##OD ' S INT ##ENTION TO K ##ILL THE INF ##ANT ME ##S ##S ##IA ##H
WHEN WE COME TO THE MORE IMPORT ##ANT CHAP ##TERS ABOUT JE ##S ##US WE MEET WITH GREAT ##ER DIFFIC ##ULT ##IES
WHILE IT IS ALWAYS ON A FR ##ID ##AY THAT THE CR ##U ##CI ##F ##IX ##ION IS COMM ##EM ##OR ##ATED THE WEE ##K IN WHICH THE DAY OCC ##UR ##S VAR ##IES FROM YEAR TO YEAR

IF WE ARE TO HAVE ANY MY ##TH ##OL ##OG ##Y AT ALL HE SEEMS TO AR ##G ##UE WHY OBJECT TO ADD ##ING TO IT THE MY ##TH ##US OF JE ##S ##US
THE IMMEDI ##ATE COMPAN ##IONS OF JE ##S ##US APPEAR TO BE ON THE OTHER HAND AS MY ##TH ##ICAL AS HE IS HIMSELF
WHO WAS MAT ##TH ##EW WHO WAS MAR ##K
WHO WERE JOHN PE ##TER JUD ##AS AND MARY
THERE IS ABS ##OL ##UTE ##LY NO EV ##IDENCE THAT THEY EVER EXIST ##ED
IF PE ##TER EVER WENT TO ROM ##E WITH A NEW DOCT ##RI ##NE HOW IS IT THAT NO HIST ##OR ##IAN HAS TAKEN NOT ##E OF HIM
HERE AGAIN WE SEE THE PRES ##ENCE OF A MY ##TH
HE WAS THE ONLY ONE WHO SAW THEM
PE ##TER PA ##UL JOHN J ##AMES JUD ##AS OCC ##UP ##Y THE ST ##AGE ALMOST EXC ##L ##US ##IVE ##LY
IT IS IMPOSS ##IBLE TO EXPL ##AIN WHY THE CONT ##EM ##P ##OR ##AR ##IES OF JE ##S ##US THE AUTHOR ##S AND HIST ##OR ##IANS OF HIS TIME DO NOT TAKE NOT ##ICE OF HIM
COULD THEY HAVE BEEN IN A CONS ##P ##IR ##AC ##Y AGAINST HIM
HOW ELSE IS THIS UN ##AN ##IM ##OUS SILENCE TO BE ACCOUNT ##ED FOR
HOW THEN ARE WE TO DEC ##IDE WHICH OF THE NUM ##ER ##OUS CAN ##D ##ID ##ATES FOR DIV ##INE HON ##ORS SHOULD BE GIVEN OUR VO ##TE ##S
AND SUCH A FAITH IS NEVER FREE IT IS ALWAYS MAIN ##TAINED BY THE SW ##ORD NOW AND BY HEL ##L FIRE HERE ##A ##FT ##ER
YET THE MOST IMPOSS ##IBLE UT ##TER ##ANCES ARE PUT IN JE ##S ##US MOUTH
ONLY A MY ##TH ##ICAL JE ##S ##US COULD VI ##R ##T ##UALLY HAND OVER THE GOVERN ##MENT OF THE UN ##IVER ##SE TO COURT ##IERS WHO HAVE PE ##T ##ITION ##S TO PRES ##S UPON HIS ATTENTION

AND WHO CAN NUMBER THE BIT ##TER DISAPP ##OINT ##MENTS CAUSE ##D BY SUCH IMPOSS ##IBLE PROM ##ISE ##S
THE SAME WHICH THE PRE ##ACH ##ERS OF TO ##DAY GIVE HE PAR ##RIED HIS ANSWER WITH MANY WORDS AND AT LENGTH SAID THAT THE PROM ##ISE WAS TO BE TAKEN WITH THE PROV ##IS ##ION THAT WHAT WE ASKED FOR WOULD BE GIVEN IF GOD THOUGHT IT FOR OUR GOOD
BUT HE SAID IF YE ASK ANYTHING IN MY NAME I WILL DO IT AND IF IT WERE NOT SO I WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU
DID HE NOT MEAN JUST WHAT HE SAID
SELF EFF ##ORT AND NOT PRAY ##ER IS THE REM ##ED ##Y AGAINST I ##GN ##OR ##ANCE SLA ##VER ##Y PO ##VER ##TY AND MOR ##AL DE ##GR ##AD ##ATION
IT WAS A NIGHT WHEN SO ##R ##RO ##W MAY COME TO THE BRIGHT ##EST WITHOUT CA ##US ##ING ANY GREAT SENSE OF INC ##ONG ##RU ##ITY WHEN WITH IMP ##RESS ##IBLE PERSON ##S LOVE BECOME ##S SOL ##IC ##IT ##OUS ##NESS HOPE S ##INK ##S TO MIS ##G ##IV ##ING AND FAITH TO HOPE WHEN THE EX ##ER ##CI ##SE OF MEM ##ORY DOES NOT ST ##IR FEELING ##S OF REG ##RET AT OPP ##ORT ##UN ##ITIES FOR AM ##BIT ##ION THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED BY AND AN ##T ##IC ##IP ##ATION DOES NOT PROM ##PT TO ENTER ##PR ##ISE
STILL TO A CLOSE OBSER ##VER THEY ARE JUST AS PER ##CEPT ##IBLE THE DIFFER ##ENCE IS THAT THEIR MED ##IA OF MAN ##IFE ##ST ##ATION ARE LESS TRI ##TE AND FAM ##IL ##IAR THAN SUCH WELL KNOWN ONE ##S AS THE BUR ##ST ##ING OF THE BU ##D ##S OR THE FALL OF THE LEA ##F
IF ANYTHING COULD BE DARK ##ER THAN THE SK ##Y IT WAS THE WALL AND IF ANY THING COULD BE GL ##OOM ##IER THAN THE WALL IT WAS THE RIVER BENE ##ATH
AN INDE ##S ##CRIB ##ABLE SUCCESS ##ION OF DU ##LL BL ##OWS PER ##PLE ##X ##ING IN THEIR REG ##ULAR ##ITY SENT THEIR SOUND WITH DIFFIC ##ULT ##Y THROUGH THE FL ##UFF ##Y AT ##M ##OS ##PH ##ERE
NOT LONG AFTER A FORM MOVE ##D BY THE BR ##INK OF THE RIVER
THIS WAS ALL THAT WAS PO ##S ##IT ##IVE ##LY DISCOVER ##ABLE THOUGH IT SEEMED HUMAN
THE SH ##APE WENT SLOWLY ALONG BUT WITHOUT MUCH EX ##ERT ##ION FOR THE SNOW THOUGH SUDDEN WAS NOT AS YET MORE THAN TWO INC ##H ##ES DEEP
AT THIS TIME SOME WORDS WERE SPOKE ##N AL ##OUD ONE
TWO THREE
FOUR FIVE
BETWEEN EACH UT ##TER ##ANCE THE LITTLE SH ##APE ADV ##ANCED ABOUT HALF A DO ##Z ##EN Y ##ARDS
HERE THE SP ##OT STOPPED AND D ##W ##IND ##LED SMALL ##ER
THEN A MOR ##SEL OF SNOW FLE ##W ACROSS THE RIVER TOWARDS THE FIF ##TH WINDOW
THE RIVER WOULD HAVE BEEN SEEN BY DAY TO BE OF THAT DEEP SM ##OO ##TH SORT WHICH RA ##CES MID ##DLE AND SIDE ##S WITH THE SAME GL ##ID ##ING PRE ##CI ##S ##ION ANY IR ##RE ##G ##ULAR ##ITIES OF SPE ##ED BEING IMMEDIATELY COR ##RE ##CTED BY A SMALL WH ##IRL ##P ##OOL
THE WINDOW WAS STRUCK AGAIN IN THE SAME MANNER
THEN A NO ##ISE WAS HEARD APP ##ARE ##N ##T ##LY PRODU ##CED BY THE OPEN ##ING OF THE WINDOW
SAID THE BL ##UR ##RED SP ##OT IN THE SNOW TRE ##M ##UL ##OUSLY
I ASKED WHICH WAS YOUR WINDOW FORG ##IVE ME
WELL I SAID THAT YOU MIGHT
O MUST I IT IS WHEN SHALL WE BE MAR ##RIED FR ##ANK
I HAVE MONEY
AND WE LIVE IN TWO PAR ##ISH ##ES DO WE WHAT THEN
IF I SAID SO OF COURSE I WILL
THE FACT IS I FORGOT TO ASK
GOOD NIGHT FR ##ANK GOOD NIGHT
THINGS ARR ##ANGE THEMSELVES
BUT THE COUNT ##ESS NEVER GAVE WAY AN INC ##H
THE FOLLOW ##ING WAS THE ANSWER WHICH SHE RETURNED TO THE NOT ##E WR ##ITT ##EN TO HER BY AUNT J ##UL ##IA
I SHOULD NOT KNOW HOW TO DRINK WIN ##E WITH THEM AND SHOULD DO A HUNDRED THINGS WHICH WOULD MAKE THEM THINK ME A BE ##AST
BUT THE GIRL BEG ##GED FOR SOME DEL ##AY
IT WAS A MATTER THAT REQU ##IRED TO BE CONSIDER ##ED
PR ##IDE IN HIM MIGHT BE AS WE ##AK AS PR ##IDE IN THEM
IF THEY WOULD PUT OUT THEIR HANDS TO HIM WHY SHOULD HE REF ##USE TO PUT OUT HIS OWN
OUR T ##AIL ##OR RECEIVED HIM COURT ##E ##OUSLY HAVING LEAR ##NED TO LIKE THE MAN UNDERSTAND ##ING THAT HE HAD BEH ##AVE ##D WITH HON ##EST ##Y AND W ##IS ##D ##OM IN REGARD TO HIS CL ##IENT AND RESPECT ##ING HIM AS ONE OF THE WORK ##ERS OF THE DAY BUT HE DECL ##ARED THAT FOR THE LOVE ##L FAMILY AS A FAMILY HE DID NOT CARE FOR THEM PARTICULAR ##LY
THEY ARE POL ##ES AS ##UND ##ER FROM ME HE SAID
BUT BY YOUR GOOD FORT ##UNE AND MER ##IT IF YOU WILL ALL ##OW ME TO SAY SO YOU HAVE TRA ##VEL ##LED FROM THE ONE POL ##E VERY FAR TOWARDS THE OTHER
AT PRESENT I THINK THAT THE SENSE OF THE COUNTRY IS IN FAV ##OUR OF AN AR ##IST ##OC ##RA ##CY OF B ##IRT ##H
WHEN YOU WERE FORE ##MOST AMONG THEM DID YOU NOT WISH TO BE THEIR MASTER
IT IS ONE TO WHICH ALL LEG ##IS ##LA ##T ##IVE AND ALL HUMAN EFF ##ORT ##S SHOULD AND MUST TEN ##D
WHEN YOU MAKE MUCH WATER BO ##IL MISTER TH ##W ##A ##ITE SOME OF IT WILL PROB ##ABLY BO ##IL OVER
I QUITE AG ##REE WITH YOU THAT THE SIL ##K GO ##WN ##S SHOULD BE KEPT FOR THEIR EL ##DER ##S AND SO THE CONVERS ##ATION WAS END ##ED
WITH HER THERE WAS A REAL WISH THAT THE POL ##ES MIGHT BE JO ##INED TOGETHER BY HER F ##UT ##URE HUSBAND
IF YOU REALLY WISH IT YOU SHALL GO HE SAID
AND A BLUE ONE TO BE MAR ##RIED IN AL ##AS ME
MUST I HAVE A P ##INK SIL ##K GO ##WN TO WALK ABOUT IN EARLY IN THE MORNING
I ' D SOON ##ER SEE YOU DA ##R ##NING MY WOR ##ST ##ED STO ##CK ##INGS SWEET ##H ##EAR ##T
I CAN DO THAT TOO
AND NOW I ' LL SIT DOWN AND WR ##ITE A LETTER TO MY LORD
HE HOPE ##D NOTHING SER ##IOUS HAD HAPPENED TO DRA ##G HER OUT AT SUCH AN UNT ##OW ##ARD TIME
BUT AS THE RA ##IN GAVE NOT THE LEAST SIGN OF CE ##S ##S ##ATION HE OBSER ##VED I THINK WE SHALL HAVE TO GO BACK NEVER
WHY NOT HE INQU ##IRED
I CANNOT UNDERSTAND HOW YOU SHOULD KNOW ME WHILE I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF YOU
OH BUT YOU KNOW ME ABOUT ME AT LEAST
I SHOULD THINK SO
HE ' S MY FATHER INDEED
BUT WE HAVE BEEN TEN ##ANTS OF SY ##L ##V ##AN ##IA CAST ##LE ON THE ISLAND HERE THIS SEA ##SON
MY FATHER ' S IS A COMP ##AR ##ATIVE ##LY HUM ##BLE RES ##IDENCE HARD BY
BUT HE COULD AFF ##ORD A MUCH BIG ##GER ONE IF HE CH ##OSE
YOU HAVE HEARD SO
I DON ' T KNOW HE DOES ##N ' T TELL ME MUCH OF HIS AFF ##AIRS
MY FATHER SHE BUR ##ST OUT SUDDENLY IS ALWAYS SC ##OLD ##ING ME FOR MY EXT ##RA ##V ##AG ##ANCE
WAS THAT THIS EVENING
AND THERE ON THE NE ##TS THEY SAT
JO ##CE ##LY ##N THOUGHT IT STRANGE THAT HE SHOULD BE THR ##OWN BY FAT ##E INTO A POSITION TO PLAY THE SON OF THE MON ##T ##AG ##UES TO THIS DAUGHTER OF THE CAP ##UL ##ETS
NO I SHALL GO ON AND GET A LO ##D ##GING IN BU ##D ##M ##OUTH TOWN IF EVER I REACH IT
IT IS SO LATE THAT THERE WILL BE NO HOUSE OPEN EXCEPT A LITTLE PLACE NEAR THE ST ##ATION WHERE YOU WON ' T CARE TO STAY
THE ISLAND WAS AN ISLAND STILL
THEY HAD NOT REAL ##IZED THE FORCE OF THE ELE ##MENTS TILL NOW
HE STE ##AD ##IED HER BO ##D ##ILY BY ENC ##IRC ##LING HER WA ##IST WITH HIS ARM AND SHE MADE NO OBJECT ##ION
HE P ##IT ##IED HER AND WHILE HE WONDER ##ED AT IT ADM ##IRED HER DETERM ##INATION
THEIR APP ##LIC ##ATION FOR ADM ##ISS ##ION LED TO THE WITH ##D ##RA ##W ##AL OF A BO ##LT AND THEY STOOD WITHIN THE G ##AS ##L ##IGHT OF THE PASS ##AGE
HE COULD SEE NOW THAT THOUGH SHE WAS SUCH A FINE FIG ##URE QUITE AS T ##ALL AS HIMSELF SHE WAS BUT IN THE BL ##OOM OF YOUNG WOMAN ##HOOD
I WILL TELL THE SERV ##ANT TO DO THIS AND SEND YOU UP SOMETHING TO EAT
HE FELT RA ##VEN ##OUSLY HUNG ##RY HIMSELF AND SET ABOUT DR ##YING HIS CLOTH ##ES AS WELL AS HE COULD AND EAT ##ING AT THE SAME TIME
BY THE A ##ID OF SOME TEM ##P ##OR ##ARY WR ##APS AND SOME SL ##IP ##PER ##S FROM THE C ##UP ##BO ##ARD HE WAS CONTR ##IV ##ING TO MAKE HIMSELF COMFORT ##ABLE WHEN THE MAID SERV ##ANT CAME DOWN ##ST ##AIRS WITH A DA ##M ##P ARM ##FUL OF WOMAN ' S RA ##IMENT
YOU ARE SLEEP ##Y MY GIRL SAID PIE ##R ##ST ##ON
HE AGAIN BECAME CONS ##CIOUS OF THE CHANGE WHICH HAD BEEN IN ##IT ##IA ##TED DURING THE WALK
THE WELL BEL ##OVE ##D WAS MO ##VING HOUSE HAD GONE OVER TO THE WE ##ARE ##R OF THIS ATT ##IRE
AND HOW ABOUT LITTLE AV ##ICE CAR ##O
SHE DRAW ##S CLOSE AND SATISF ##IES
HE COULD NOT FORG ##ET MISSUS P ##INE AV ##ON ' S EYES THOUGH HE REMEMBER ##ED NOTHING OF HER OTHER FA ##CI ##AL DET ##AIL ##S
AFTER ##WARDS THEY KEPT AP ##ART AW ##H ##ILE IN THE DRAW ##ING ROOM FOR FORM ' S SA ##KE BUT EVEN ##T ##UALLY GRA ##V ##IT ##ATED TOGETHER AGAIN AND FIN ##ISHED THE EVENING IN EACH OTHER ' S COMPANY
BUT THIS WAS NOT ALL
BUT WAS HE ABLE
IT WAS UN ##F ##AIR TO GO FURTHER WITHOUT TELL ##ING HER EVEN THOUGH H ##ITHER ##TO SUCH EXPL ##IC ##IT ##NESS HAD NOT BEEN ABS ##OL ##UTE ##LY DEM ##AND ##ED
HE DETERM ##INED TO CALL IMMEDIATELY ON THE NEW INC ##AR ##N ##ATION
SHE LIVED NOT FAR FROM THE LONG FA ##SH ##ION ##ABLE HA ##M ##PT ##ONS ##H ##IRE SQU ##ARE AND HE WENT TH ##ITHER WITH EXPECT ##ATIONS OF HAVING A HIGH ##LY EM ##OT ##ION ##AL TIME AT LEAST
BUT SOME ##H ##OW THE VERY BELL PULL SEEMED COLD ALTHOUGH SHE HAD SO EAR ##NE ##ST ##LY ASKED HIM TO COME
RA ##ISING HER EYES IN A SLIGHT ##LY INQU ##IR ##ING MANNER FROM THE BOOK SHE WAS READ ##ING SHE LEA ##N ##T BACK IN THE CHAIR AS IF SO ##AKING HERSELF IN LU ##X ##UR ##IOUS SENS ##ATIONS WHICH HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH HIM AND REPLIED TO HIS GRE ##ET ##ING WITH A FEW COMMON ##PL ##ACE WORDS
JUST AS THEY TURN MADE ##IR ##A INTO PORT IN THE SP ##ACE OF A SING ##LE NIGHT SO THIS OLD AIR HAS BEEN TAKEN AND DOCTOR ##ED AND TW ##IST ##ED ABOUT AND BROUGHT OUT AS A NEW PO ##P ##ULAR D ##ITT ##Y INDEED
SHE TH ##AW ##ED A LITTLE AND THEN THEY WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT HER HOUSE WHICH HAD BEEN NEW ##LY PAIN ##TED AND DEC ##OR ##ATED WITH GREEN ##ISH BLUE SAT ##IN UP TO THE HE ##IGHT OF A PERSON ' S HEAD AN ARR ##ANGE ##MENT THAT SOME ##WH ##AT IMP ##RO ##VED HER SLIGHT ##LY FA ##DE ##D THOUGH STILL PRETTY FACE AND WAS HELP ##ED BY THE AW ##NING ##S OVER THE WINDOW ##S
YES I HAVE HAD MY HOUSE SOME YEARS SHE OBSER ##VED COMP ##LA ##CE ##N ##T ##LY AND I LIKE IT BETTER EVERY YEAR
DON ' T YOU FEEL LO ##NE ##LY IN IT SOMETIMES O NEVER
WHAT AN UNC ##IV ##IL THING TO SAY SHE MUR ##M ##URED IN SURPR ##ISE
IT IS RATHER UNC ##IV ##IL
AS A P ##UN ##ISH ##MENT SHE DID NOT R ##ING THE BELL BUT LEFT HIM TO FIND HIS WAY OUT AS HE COULD
I SAW HIM AT LADY CH ##AN ##NE ##L ##CL ##IFF ##E ' S THE OTHER NIGHT
JO ##CE ##LY ##N PIE ##R ##ST ##ON
O DIDN ' T HE MAR ##RY HER
SAID MISSUS P ##INE AV ##ON WITH A START
BUT JO ##CE ##LY ##N WAS REC ##ED ##ING FROM THE PRETTY W ##ID ##OW ' S HOUSE WITH LONG STRI ##DE ##S
LADY IR ##IS HAD LEFT THE DRAW ##ING ROOM FOR A MOMENT TO SEE THAT ALL WAS RIGHT IN THE DIN ##ING ROOM AND WHEN HE WAS SHOW ##N IN THERE STOOD ALONE IN THE LA ##M ##PL ##IGHT N ##ICH ##OL ##A P ##INE AV ##ON
SHE HAD BEEN THE FIRST ARRI ##VAL
AS THE OTHER GU ##EST ##S DRO ##PPED IN THE PA ##IR RET ##REAT ##ED INTO A SHAD ##Y CORN ##ER AND SHE TALK ##ED BESIDE HIM TILL ALL MOVE ##D OFF FOR THE EAT ##ING AND DRINK ##ING
HE HAD NOT BEEN APP ##OINT ##ED TO TAKE HER ACROSS TO THE DIN ##ING ROOM BUT AT THE TABLE FOUND HER EXACT ##LY OPP ##OS ##ITE
THE SPR ##ING IN THE PRESENT CASE WAS THE ART ##IST ##IC COMM ##END ##ATION SHE DES ##ER ##VED AND CRA ##VED
THE LADY ON JO ##CE ##LY ##N ' S LEFT WIFE OF A LORD JUST ##ICE OF APP ##E ##AL WAS IN LIKE MANNER TALK ##ING TO HER COMPAN ##ION ON THE OUT ##ER SIDE SO THAT FOR THE TIME HE WAS LEFT TO HIMSELF
IT CAME FROM THE WIFE OF ONE OF HIS FATHER ' S FORM ##ER WORK ##MEN AND WAS CONCER ##NING HER SON WHOM SHE BEG ##GED JO ##CE ##LY ##N TO RECO ##M ##MEN ##D AS CAN ##D ##ID ##ATE FOR SOME POST IN TOWN THAT SHE WISH ##ED HIM TO F ##ILL
WHAT IS NECESSARY TO THE COMPLE ##TEN ##ESS OF THE STORY AT THIS ST ##AGE IS NOT TO REC ##AP ##IT ##UL ##ATE BUT TO TAKE UP SOME OF THE LO ##OSE END ##S OF THR ##EAD ##S WO ##VEN IN AND FOLLOW THEM THROUGH UNTIL THE CLEAR AND COMP ##RE ##H ##ENS ##IVE PICT ##URE OF EVEN ##TS CAN BE SEEN
THE WAY OF THE INV ##ENT ##OR IS HARD
HE CAN SOMETIMES RA ##ISE CAP ##IT ##AL TO HELP HIM IN WORK ##ING OUT HIS CR ##UDE CON ##CEPT ##IONS BUT EVEN THEN IT IS FRE ##QU ##ENTLY DONE AT A DIST ##RESS ##FUL CO ##ST OF PERSON ##AL SUR ##REN ##DER
WHEN THE RES ##ULT IS AC ##H ##IE ##VED THE INV ##ENTION MAKES ITS APP ##E ##AL ON THE SC ##ORE OF E ##CO ##N ##OM ##Y OF MAT ##ER ##IAL OR OF EFF ##ORT AND THEN LAB ##OR OFTEN AW ##A ##ITS WITH CR ##USH ##ING AND TY ##RA ##N ##N ##ICAL SPIRIT TO SM ##ASH THE APP ##AR ##AT ##US OR FOR ##B ##ID ITS VERY USE
POSS ##IB ##LY OUR NAT ##ION ##AL OP ##T ##IM ##ISM AS REV ##E ##ALE ##D IN INV ##ENTION THE SEE ##KING A HIGH ##ER GOOD NEED ##S SOME CHE ##CK
POSS ##IB ##LY THE LEAD ##ERS WOULD TRA ##VEL TOO FAST AND TOO FAR ON THE ROAD TO PERFECT ##ION IF CONSE ##R ##V ##AT ##ISM DID NOT ALSO PLAY ITS SAL ##UT ##ARY PART IN INS ##IST ##ING THAT THE PRO ##CESS ##ION MOVE FORWARD AS A WHOLE
ON THE CONTR ##ARY THE COND ##ITION ##S FOR ITS ACCEPT ##ANCE HAD BEEN R ##IP ##ENING FAST
YET THE VERY VO ##G ##UE OF THE ELE ##CT ##RIC AR ##C LIGHT MADE HARD ##ER THE ARRI ##VAL OF THE INC ##AND ##ES ##CE ##N ##T
A NUMBER OF PAR ##ENT AR ##C LIGHT ##ING COMPAN ##IES WERE IN EXIST ##ENCE AND A GREAT MANY LO ##C ##AL COMPAN ##IES HAD BEEN CALLED INTO BEING UNDER FR ##AN ##CH ##ISE ##S FOR COMM ##ER ##CI ##AL BUSINESS AND TO EX ##E ##C ##UTE REG ##ULAR CITY CONTR ##ACT ##S FOR STREET LIGHT ##ING
THUS IN A CUR ##IOUS MANNER THE MO ##DER ##N ART OF ELE ##CT ##RIC LIGHT ##ING WAS IN A VERY TRUE SENSE DIV ##IDED AGAINST ITSELF WITH INT ##ENSE R ##IV ##AL ##RIE ##S AND JE ##AL ##OUS ##IES WHICH WERE NONE THE LESS REAL BECAUSE THEY WERE BUT TEM ##P ##OR ##ARY AND OCC ##UR ##RED IN A FIELD WHERE U ##LT ##IM ##ATE UN ##ION OF FORCE ##S WAS IN ##E ##V ##IT ##ABLE
HEN ##CE TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE FIRST ED ##ISON ST ##ATIONS WERE EST ##AB ##LISH ##ED THE MET ##H ##OD ##S THEY INV ##OL ##VED COULD BE FAIR ##LY CRE ##D ##ITED WITH NO LESS THAN SIX ##TY SEVEN PER CENT
IT WILL BE READ ##ILY UNDERST ##OOD THAT UNDER THESE COND ##ITION ##S THE MO ##DER ##N LIGHT ##ING COMPANY SUPP ##L ##IES TO ITS C ##USTOM ##ERS BOTH INC ##AND ##ES ##CE ##N ##T AND AR ##C LIGHT ##ING FRE ##QU ##ENTLY FROM THE SAME D ##Y ##N ##AM ##O ELE ##CT ##RIC MA ##CH ##INE ##RY AS A SOU ##R ##CE OF CUR ##REN ##T AND THAT THE OLD FE ##UD AS BETWEEN THE R ##IV ##AL SY ##ST ##EM ##S HAS DIED OUT
IN FACT FOR SOME YEARS PAST THE PRES ##IDENT ##S OF THE NAT ##ION ##AL ELE ##CT ##RIC LIGHT ASS ##OC ##IA ##T ##ION HAVE BEEN CH ##OSE ##N ALMOST EXC ##L ##US ##IVE ##LY FROM AMONG THE MAN ##AGER ##S OF THE GREAT ED ##ISON LIGHT ##ING COMPAN ##IES IN THE LEAD ##ING C ##ITIES
THE OTHER STRONG OPP ##OSITION TO THE INC ##AND ##ES ##CE ##N ##T LIGHT CAME FROM THE G ##AS IND ##UST ##RY
THERE ALSO THE MOST BIT ##TER FEELING WAS SHOW ##N
THE G ##AS MAN ##AGER DID NOT LIKE THE AR ##C LIGHT BUT IT INTER ##FE ##RED ONLY WITH HIS STREET SERV ##ICE WHICH WAS NOT HIS LARGE ##ST SOU ##R ##CE OF INC ##OME BY ANY MEANS
HERE AGAIN WAS GIVEN A MOST CONV ##IN ##CING DEM ##ONS ##T ##RA ##T ##ION OF THE TRUTH THAT SUCH AN ADD ##ITION TO THE RES ##OUR ##CES OF MAN ##K ##IND ALWAYS CAR ##RIE ##S WITH IT UN ##S ##US ##PECT ##ED BENE ##F ##ITS EVEN FOR ITS ENEM ##IES
THIS WAS NOT LONG NOR UN ##IVER ##S ##ALLY THE SPIRIT SHOW ##N AND TO DAY IN HUNDRED ##S OF C ##ITIES THE ELE ##CT ##RIC AND G ##AS PROPER ##T ##IES ARE UN ##ITED UNDER THE ONE MAN ##AGE ##MENT WHICH DOES NOT FIND IT IMPOSS ##IBLE TO P ##USH IN A FRIEND ##LY AND PRO ##GR ##ESS ##IVE WAY THE USE OF BOTH ILL ##UM ##IN ##ANTS
THE MOST CONS ##P ##IC ##U ##OUS EXAM ##PLE OF THIS IDE ##N ##T ##ITY OF INTEREST IS GIVEN IN NEW Y ##OR ##K ITSELF
SO MUCH FOR THE EARLY OPP ##OSITION OF WHICH THERE WAS PLE ##N ##TY
BUT IT MAY BE QUESTION ##ED WHETHER IN ##ERT ##IA IS NOT EQU ##ALLY TO BE DR ##EAD ##ED WITH ACT ##IVE ILL WILL
OF COURSE A GREAT MANY ACCOUNT ##S WERE WR ##ITT ##EN AND READ BUT WHILE GEN ##U ##INE INTEREST WAS AR ##OUSE ##D IT WAS NECESS ##AR ##ILY AP ##ATH ##ET ##IC
WE GOT IT AT A GREAT BAR ##G ##AIN AND ONLY PA ##ID A SMALL SUM DOWN AND THE B ##AL ##ANCE ON MOR ##T ##G ##AGE

THE FOUR ##TH YEAR I GOT IT DOWN TO THIRTY SEVEN CENT ##S AND I MADE ALL THE MONEY UP IN ONE YEAR THAT I HAD LOST PRE ##V ##IOUSLY

ANOTHER VISIT ##OR WHO USED TO GIVE US A GOOD DEAL OF AM ##USE ##MENT AND PLEASURE WAS CAPTAIN SH ##AW THE HEAD OF THE LONDON FIRE BR ##IG ##ADE

WHY LET HIM OUT OF YOUR SIGHT
IT WAS ONLY NOW AT THE ELE ##VENT ##H HOUR THAT THE IT ##AL ##IAN HAD BECOME INC ##UL ##P ##ATED AND THE QUESTION OF HIS POSSIBLE ANX ##IET ##Y TO ESC ##APE HAD NEVER BEEN CONSIDER ##ED
HE LEFT EVERYTHING BEHIND
HAND IT ME SAID THE CHIEF AND WHEN IT CAME INTO HIS HANDS HE BEGAN TO TURN OVER THE LEAVE ##S HUR ##RIED ##LY
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND NOT MORE THAN A WORD HERE AND THERE
IT IS NO DOUBT IT ##AL ##IAN
OF COURSE SUCH A CONS ##UM ##MA ##TE ASS AS YOU HAVE PROV ##ED YOURSELF WOULD NOT THINK OF SEA ##R ##CHING THE REST ##AU ##RA ##N ##T OR THE IMMEDI ##ATE NEIGHB ##OUR ##HOOD OR OF MAKING INQU ##IR ##IES AS TO WHETHER HE HAD BEEN SEEN OR AS TO WHICH WAY HE HAD GONE
IT WAS A NOT ##E FOR A HUNDRED LI ##RE A HUNDRED FR ##AN ##C ##S AND THE REST ##AU ##RA ##N ##T BILL WAS NO MORE THAN SEVENT ##EEN FR ##AN ##C ##S HA ##H
HE WAS MUCH PRES ##SE ##D IN A GREAT HUR ##RY
DIRECT ##LY HE CROSS ##ED THE THR ##ESH ##OLD HE CALLED THE FIRST CA ##B AND WAS DRI ##VING AWAY BUT HE WAS STOPPED THE DEV ##IL
HE WISH ##ED TO PASS ON TO LEAVE HER SHE WOULD NOT CONSE ##N ##T THEN THEY BOTH GOT INTO THE CA ##B AND WERE DRI ##VEN AWAY TOGETHER
THE SOCI ##AL ATT ##ITUDE TOWARDS SM ##OK ##ING IN EARLY VICT ##OR ##IAN DAYS AND FOR SOME TIME LATER WAS CUR ##IOUS
NOW MISSUS QU ##IL ##P HE SAYS I FEEL IN A SM ##OK ##ING HUM ##OUR AND SHALL PROB ##ABLY BLA ##Z ##E AWAY ALL NIGHT

THERE WERE STILL PLE ##N ##TY OF ACT ##IVE OPP ##ONE ##N ##TS AND DEN ##OUN ##CER ##S OF TO ##B ##AC ##CO

HE ORDER ##ED US TO RET ##REAT AND ALL OUR EFF ##ORT ##S AND LO ##S ##SE ##S WENT FOR NOTHING
SO IT HAS BEEN WITH BAR ##CL ##AY
WHILE RU ##S ##S ##IA WAS WELL A FORE ##IGN ##ER COULD SERV ##E HER AND BE A SP ##LE ##ND ##ID MIN ##ISTER BUT AS SOON AS SHE IS IN DANGER SHE NEED ##S ONE OF HER OWN K ##IN

I WANT TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT SOMETHING VERY SER ##IOUS TO US ALL

MISTER LE ##N ##N ##O ##X HAD NEVER HAD THE OPP ##ORT ##UN ##ITY OF HAVING ANY PRIV ##ATE CONVERS ##ATION WITH HER FATHER AFTER HER REF ##US ##AL OR ELSE THAT WOULD INDEED BE A VERY SER ##IOUS AFF ##AIR
BUT SHE SOON FELT IT WAS NOT ABOUT ANYTHING WHICH HAVING ONLY LATE ##LY AND SUDDENLY OCC ##UR ##RED COULD HAVE GIVEN R ##ISE TO ANY COMP ##LIC ##ATED THOUGHTS THAT HER FATHER WISH ##ED TO SPEAK TO HER
MISTER HA ##LE DID NOT ANSWER FOR A MIN ##UTE OR TWO
MARGARET COULD NOT BEAR THE SIGHT OF THE SUS ##PE ##N ##SE WHICH WAS EVEN MORE DIST ##RESS ##ING TO HER FATHER THAN TO HERSELF
BUT WHY DEAR PAP ##A DO TELL ME
BECAUSE I MUST NO LONGER BE A MIN ##ISTER IN THE CHURCH OF ENGLAND
BUT NOTHING TO THE SHO ##CK SHE RECEIVED FROM MISTER HA ##LE ' S LAST SPE ##E ##CH WHAT COULD HE MEAN
IT WAS ALL THE WOR ##SE FOR BEING SO MY ##STER ##IOUS
WHY CAN YOU NO LONGER BE A CLE ##R ##GY ##MAN

MARGARET S ##IGH ##ED AS IF STANDING ON THE VER ##GE OF SOME NEW HOR ##RO ##R
MARGARET HOW I LOVE THE HO ##LY CHURCH FROM WHICH I AM TO BE SH ##UT OUT

GOD FORG ##IVE ME
HE ROSE AND WALKED UP AND DOWN THE ROOM SPEAK ##ING LOW WORDS OF SELF REP ##RO ##ACH AND HUM ##IL ##IA ##T ##ION OF WHICH MARGARET WAS THAN ##K ##FUL TO HEAR BUT FEW

I RES ##P ##OND ##ED THAT HE HAD DONE WELL TO TELL ME SO AND THAT I WOULD TAKE SUCH CARE OF THEM THAT HE SHOULD NEVER SEE THEM MORE

TO BE SURE IT SEEMS A SH ##AME YET IF I COULD STE ##AL THE MONEY THIS PR ##IEST IS BO ##AST ##ING ABOUT I COULD LIVE AT EAS ##E FOR THE REST OF MY DAYS AND SO HE BEGAN CAST ##ING ABOUT HOW BEST HE MIGHT COMP ##ASS HIS PURPOSE
BUT THE PR ##IEST FAR FROM GU ##ESS ##ING THE DRI ##FT OF HIS COM ##RA ##DE ' S THOUGHTS JOUR ##NEY ##ED CHE ##ER ##FULLY ON TILL THEY REACHED THE TOWN OF K ##U ##AN ##A
HERE THERE IS AN ARM OF THE SEA WHICH IS CROSS ##ED IN FE ##R ##RY BOAT ##S THAT START AS SOON AS SOME TWENTY OR THIRTY PASS ##ENG ##ERS ARE GATHER ##ED TOGETHER AND IN ONE OF THESE BOAT ##S THE TWO TRA ##VEL ##LER ##S EMB ##ARK ##ED

WHEN HE SAW THIS THE RO ##N ##IN FE ##IGN ##ED THE UT ##MOST GR ##IEF AND DIS ##MA ##Y AND SAID TO HIS FELLOW PASS ##ENG ##ERS THIS PR ##IEST WHOM WE HAVE JUST LOST WAS MY CO ##US ##IN HE WAS GOING TO K ##I ##Y ##OT ##O TO VISIT THE SH ##RI ##NE OF HIS PAT ##RO ##N AND AS I HAPPENED TO HAVE BUSINESS THERE AS WELL WE SET ##TLE ##D TO TRA ##VEL TOGETHER
NOW AL ##AS BY THIS MIS ##FORT ##UNE MY CO ##US ##IN IS DEAD AND I AM LEFT ALONE
HE SPOKE SO FEELING ##LY AND WE ##PT SO FREE ##LY THAT THE PASS ##ENG ##ERS BELIEVE ##D HIS STORY AND P ##IT ##IED AND TRIED TO COMFORT HIM
THEN THE RO ##N ##IN SAID TO THE BOAT ##MEN
WHAT THINK YOU GENTLE ##MEN ADDED HE TURN ##ING TO THE OTHER TRA ##VEL ##LER ##S
THEY OF COURSE WERE ONLY TOO GLAD TO AV ##O ##ID ANY H ##IND ##RA ##N ##CE TO THEIR ON ##WARD JOUR ##NEY AND ALL WITH ONE VOICE AG ##REE ##D TO WHAT THE RO ##N ##IN HAD PROP ##OSED AND SO THE MATTER WAS SET ##TLE ##D

NO WELL MAN ##AGED FAMILY WOULD THINK OF BUILD ##ING A NEW HOUSE WITHOUT FIND ##ING IN WHAT DIRECT ##ION TO FACE THE FRONT DOOR
AFTER THIS MATTER HAS BEEN SET ##TLE ##D AND THE HOUSE IS FAIR ##LY BEG ##UN THERE ARE OCCASION ##AL CR ##ISE ##S IN ITS CONST ##RU ##CTION UPON WHICH MUCH DEP ##END ##S

ANOTHER FAV ##OR ##ITE PRESENT AT THIS TIME AMONG BU ##D ##D ##H ##ISTS IS A CA ##GE OF LIVING BIRD ##S TO BE BORN ##E TO THE GRA ##VE AND REL ##E ##ASED THERE ##ON
IT SEEMS MORE LIKE A BR ##ID ##AL THAN A BUR ##IAL
DURING THIS PER ##I ##OD THE SPIRIT OF THE DEC ##E ##ASED IS SUPPOSE ##D TO BE STILL IN ##H ##AB ##ITING THE HOUSE AND A TABLE ##T OR SH ##RI ##NE IS SET UP IN THE DEATH CH ##AM ##BER BEFORE WHICH FOOD AND FLO ##W ##ERS ARE RE ##NE ##W ##ED DA ##ILY

THE EN ##RA ##GED HUSBAND WELL KNOW ##ING THAT HE SHOULD FEEL A BL ##OW IF HE WAIT ##ED TO HEAR THE ORDER REPE ##ATED INST ##ANTLY RET ##REAT ##ED AND WENT DOWN THE RIVER TO HIS CAT ##TLE

ALL ##EN MADE HIS TR ##OWS ##ERS HIMSELF AND THEN BU ##ILT A RA ##FT ON WHICH HE WENT DOWN THE RIVER TO HIS OWN PLACE AT MO ##UNT MOR ##RI ##S
THERE AN IND ##IAN GAVE HIM SOME REF ##RES ##H ##MENT AND A GOOD GU ##N WITH WHICH HE HAST ##ENED ON TO LITTLE BEAR ##D ' S TOWN WHERE HE FOUND HIS SQU ##AW
NOT DA ##RI ##NG TO R ##IS ##K HIMSELF AT THAT PLACE FOR FEAR OF BEING GIVEN UP HE MADE HER BUT A SHORT VISIT AND CAME IMMEDIATELY TO GARD ##OW
THE LOVE OF LI ##BERT ##Y HOWEVER ADDED TO HIS NATURAL SW ##IFT ##NESS GAVE HIM SUFF ##IC ##IENT STRENGTH TO MAKE HIS ESC ##APE TO HIS FORM ##ER CAST ##LE OF SA ##FE ##TY
HIS PUR ##S ##UE ##R ##S CAME IMMEDIATELY TO MY HOUSE WHERE THEY EXPECT ##ED TO HAVE FOUND HIM SECRET ##ED AND UNDER MY PROT ##ECT ##ION
STILL UN ##S ##AT ##ISF ##IED AND DOUBT ##ING MY VER ##AC ##ITY THEY ADV ##ISED MY IND ##IAN BROTHER TO USE HIS INFL ##UE ##N ##CE TO DRAW FROM ME THE SECRET OF HIS CON ##CE ##AL ##MENT WHICH THEY HAD AN IDEA THAT I CONSIDER ##ED OF GREAT IMPORT ##ANCE NOT ONLY TO HIM BUT TO MYSELF I PERS ##IST ##ED IN MY I ##GN ##OR ##ANCE OF HIS SIT ##U ##ATION AND FIN ##ALLY THEY LEFT ME
HE CAME TO MY HOUSE IN THE NIGHT AND AW ##OKE ME WITH THE GREAT ##EST CA ##UTION FEAR ##ING THAT SOME OF HIS ENEM ##IES MIGHT BE WATCH ##ING TO TAKE HIM AT A TIME WHEN AND IN A PLACE WHERE IT WOULD BE IMPOSS ##IBLE FOR HIM TO MAKE HIS ESC ##APE
AT THAT TIME ALL ##EN LAY IN A SECRET PLACE IN THE GU ##L ##PH A SHORT DISTANCE ABOVE MY FL ##ATS IN A HO ##LE THAT HE ACC ##IDENT ##ALLY FOUND IN THE ROCK NEAR THE RIVER

IT ' S NOT LIKE ##LY AT THIS HOUR UN ##LESS IT BE THE OWN ##ER OF A BAD CONS ##CI ##ENCE WHO CAN ' T SLEEP
TR ##OTH THERE ' S ONE SUCH WITHIN THOSE WALL ##S
IF HE BE AB ##RO ##AD THERE ' S A GOOD CHANCE OF HIS SEEING ME ON THE OPEN GROUND NOT THAT I SHOULD CARE A STRA ##W IF IT WERE ONLY MYSELF TO BE COMP ##RO ##M ##ISED
IT ' S NO USE WAIT ##ING UPON THE MOON DE ##U ##CE TAKE HER
IT IS TRUE HE HAD DES ##IGN ##S UPON THE HA ##CI ##END ##A BUT THESE DID NOT CONT ##EM ##PL ##ATE EITHER ITS CA ##SH PLA ##TE OR JE ##W ##ELL ##ERY IF WE EXCEPT THE MOST PRE ##CIOUS JE ##W ##EL IT CONT ##AINED THE MIST ##RESS OF THE MAN ##S ##ION HERSELF
THE CHURCH BELL ##S WERE R ##ING ##ING AND PEOPLE ON THE AV ##EN ##UE GOING BY TO SERV ##ICE TURNED CUR ##IOUS INQU ##IR ##ING LOOK ##S UP AT THE GREAT HOUSE AND THEN WENT ON TALK ##ING OF THE REC ##ENT EVEN ##TS WHICH HAD SO STRANGE ##LY ENTERED INTO AND MADE HIST ##ORY IN THE CITY
AND ALL THROUGH HIS IMP ##ASS ##ION ##ED APP ##E ##AL THIS MORNING THERE WAS A NOT ##E OF SAD ##NESS AND RE ##B ##U ##KE AND STE ##R ##N COND ##EM ##N ##ATION THAT MADE MANY OF THE MEM ##BER ##S PAL ##E WITH SELF ACC ##US ##ATION OR WITH IN ##WARD ANG ##ER
RA ##Y ##M ##OND HAD VO ##TED TO CONTIN ##UE FOR ANOTHER YEAR THE SAL ##OON
THE CHRIST ##IANS OF RA ##Y ##M ##OND STOOD COND ##EM ##NED BY THE RES ##ULT
FOR THAT HAD BEEN THE FACT IN RA ##Y ##M ##OND FOR YEARS THE SAL ##OON RU ##LED
PRES ##IDENT MAR ##SH SAT THERE HIS US ##UAL ER ##ECT HANDS ##OME FIR ##M BRIGHT SELF CONF ##IDENT BEAR ##ING ALL GONE HIS HEAD BO ##W ##ED UPON HIS BRE ##AST THE GREAT TEARS RO ##LL ##ING DOWN HIS CHE ##E ##KS UN ##M ##IND ##FUL OF THE FACT THAT NEVER BEFORE HAD HE SHOW ##N OUT ##WARD EM ##OT ##ION IN A PUBLIC SERV ##ICE
WHAT IF HE HAD BEG ##UN TO DO AS JE ##S ##US WOULD HAVE DONE LONG AGO
WHEN HAD THE FIRST CHURCH Y ##IELD ##ED TO SUCH A B ##AP ##T ##ISM OF TEARS
WHAT HAD BECOME OF ITS REG ##ULAR PRE ##CI ##SE CONV ##ENTION ##AL ORDER OF SERV ##ICE UN ##D ##IST ##UR ##BED BY ANY V ##UL ##GAR EM ##OT ##ION AND UN ##M ##OVE ##D BY ANY FOOL ##ISH EXC ##ITE ##MENT
THEY HAD BEEN LIVING SO LONG ON THEIR SUR ##F ##ACE FEELING ##S THAT THEY HAD ALMOST FORGOT ##TEN THE DEEP ##ER WELL ##S OF LIFE
THE MEET ##ING WAS TEN ##DER IT GL ##OWED WITH THE SPIRIT ' S PRES ##ENCE IT WAS AL ##IVE WITH STRONG AND LAST ##ING RESOL ##VE TO BEGIN A WAR ON THE WHIS ##KE ##Y POWER IN RA ##Y ##M ##OND THAT WOULD BREAK ITS RE ##IGN FORE ##VER
SINCE THE FIRST SUN ##DAY WHEN THE FIRST COMPANY OF VO ##L ##UNT ##EE ##R ##S HAD PLE ##D ##GED THEMSELVES TO DO AS JE ##S ##US WOULD DO THE DIFFERENT MEET ##INGS HAD BEEN CHARACTER ##IZED BY DIST ##INCT IMP ##UL ##SE ##S OR IMP ##RESS ##IONS
AND ALL THROUGH IT RAN ONE GENERAL CRY FOR DEL ##IVER ##ANCE FROM THE SAL ##OON AND ITS AW ##FUL CUR ##SE
GRA ##Y AND HIS WIFE WERE BES ##IE ##GED BY INQU ##IRE ##R ##S WHO WANTED TO KNOW WHAT LO ##REE ##N ' S FRIENDS AND ACQU ##AINT ##ANCES WERE EXPECT ##ED TO DO IN PAY ##ING THEIR LAST RESPECT ##S TO HER
GRA ##Y HAD GONE UP TO VI ##R ##GIN ##IA ' S AND AFTER TALK ##ING IT OVER WITH HER AND MA ##X ##W ##ELL THE ARR ##ANGE ##MENT HAD BEEN MADE
I AM AND ALWAYS HAVE BEEN OPP ##OSED TO LARGE PUBLIC F ##UNE ##RA ##LS SAID GRA ##Y WHOSE COMPLE ##TE WHOLE ##SO ##ME SIM ##PL ##IC ##ITY OF CHARACTER WAS ONE OF ITS GREAT SOU ##R ##CES OF STRENGTH BUT THE CRY OF THE POOR CREAT ##URES WHO KNEW LO ##REE ##N IS SO EAR ##NE ##ST THAT I DO NOT KNOW HOW TO REF ##USE THIS DESIRE TO SEE HER AND PAY HER POOR BODY SOME LAST LITTLE HON ##OR WHAT DO YOU THINK MISTER MA ##X ##W ##ELL
I WILL BE GU ##IDED BY YOUR JUD ##G ##MENT IN THE MATTER
I AM SURE THAT WHATEVER YOU AND MISS PA ##GE THINK BEST WILL BE RIGHT
UNDER THE CIRCUMST ##ANCES I HAVE A GREAT DIST ##AST ##E FOR WHAT SEEMS LIKE DISP ##LA ##Y AT SUCH TIMES BUT THIS SEEMS DIFFERENT
IT HAPPENED THAT THAT AFTER ##N ##OON A SOME ##WH ##AT NOT ##ED NEWS ##P ##APE ##R COR ##RES ##P ##OND ##ENT WAS PASS ##ING THROUGH RA ##Y ##M ##OND ON HIS WAY TO AN ED ##IT ##OR ##IAL CONV ##ENTION IN A NEIGHB ##OR ##ING CITY
SHE WAS A COMMON STREET DR ##UN ##K ##ARD AND YET THE SERV ##ICES AT THE TEN ##T WERE AS IMP ##RESS ##IVE AS ANY I EVER W ##IT ##NESS ##ED IN A MET ##RO ##P ##OL ##IT ##AN CHURCH OVER THE MOST DIST ##ING ##U ##ISHED C ##IT ##IZE ##N
IT STRUCK ME OF COURSE BEING A STRANGE ##R IN THE PLACE WITH CONSIDER ##ABLE AST ##ON ##ISH ##MENT TO HEAR VOICE ##S LIKE THOSE ONE NATURAL ##LY EXPECT ##S TO HEAR ONLY IN GREAT CHURCH ##ES OR CONCER ##TS AT SUCH A MEET ##ING AS THIS
MISTER MA ##X ##W ##ELL SPOKE OF THE FACT THAT THE DEAD WOMAN HAD BEEN FULL ##Y PREP ##ARED TO GO BUT HE SPOKE IN A PE ##CUL ##IAR ##LY SENS ##IT ##IVE MANNER OF THE EFFECT OF THE LI ##QU ##OR BUSINESS ON THE LIVE ##S OF MEN AND WOMEN LIKE THIS ONE
RA ##Y ##M ##OND OF COURSE BEING A RA ##IL ##RO ##AD TOWN AND THE CENT ##RE OF THE GREAT PA ##CK ##ING INTEREST ##S FOR THIS REG ##ION IS FULL OF SAL ##OON ##S
THEN FOLLOWED WHAT WAS PERHAPS THE QU ##EE ##R PART OF THIS STRANGE SERV ##ICE
IT WAS ONE OF THE SIM ##PLE ##ST AND AT THE SAME TIME ONE OF THE MOST IMP ##RESS ##IVE SIGHT ##S I EVER W ##IT ##NESS ##ED
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN A HUNDRED OF THESE WOMEN AND I WAS TOLD MANY OF THEM HAD BEEN CONV ##ERT ##ED AT THE MEET ##INGS JUST REC ##ENTLY

DON ' T WANT YOU TO GET READY RET ##ORT ##ED BE ##R ##T ##RA ##M PROM ##PT ##LY I SAW MAR ##IE GET READY AND I HAD ALL I WANTED OF IT
IF YOU REALLY MUST HAVE ALL THOSE MILES OF TABLE ##CL ##OTH ##S AND N ##AP ##K ##INS AND DO ##IL ##IES AND LA ##CE RU ##FF ##LING ##S WE ' LL DO IT AFTER ##WARDS NOT BEFORE BUT
BESIDES I NEED YOU TO TAKE CARE OF ME CUT IN BE ##R ##T ##RA ##M CRA ##FT ##ILY
THE TEN ##DER GL ##OW ON BILL ##Y ' S FACE TOLD ITS OWN STORY AND BE ##R ##T ##RA ##M ' S E ##AGER EYES WERE NOT SLOW TO READ IT
SWEET ##H ##EAR ##T SEE HERE DEAR HE CRIED SOFT ##LY T ##IGHT ##ENING HIS GOOD LEFT ARM
BILL ##Y MY DEAR
IT WAS AUNT HA ##N ##N ##AH ' S PLAIN ##T ##IVE VOICE AT THE DOOR ##WAY A LITTLE LATER
WE MUST GO HOME AND WILL ##IAM IS HERE TOO AND WANT ##S TO SEE YOU
YOU MEAN IT ' LL BE BEFORE O ##CT ##O ##BER
AUNT HA ##N ##N ##AH GL ##ANCED FROM ONE TO THE OTHER UNC ##ERTAIN ##LY
YES NO ##D ##DE ##D BILL ##Y DEM ##URE ##LY
YES I KNOW THAT IS A GOOD WHILE CUT IN BE ##R ##T ##RA ##M AIR ##ILY
WE WANTED IT TO MOR ##RO ##W BUT WE HAD TO WAIT ON ACCOUNT OF THE NEW LI ##CE ##N ##SE LAW
YET SO STRONG WAS THE EFFECT UPON HIM OF CONT ##EM ##PL ##ATING A LARGE FORT ##UNE THAT IN DESP ##ITE OF REASON AND DESIRE HE LIVED IN E ##AGER EXPECT ##ATION OF THE WORD WHICH SHOULD MAKE HIM RICH
A PART OF THAT IMP ##RESS ##ION WAS DU ##E TO THE ENG ##AGE ##MENT WHICH HE MUST NOW F ##UL ##F ##IL
TO SH ##UFF ##LE OUT OF THIS DUT ##Y WOULD MAKE HIM TOO I ##GN ##O ##BLE EVEN IN HIS OWN EYES
BECAUSE IN HIS SAL ##AD DAYS HE DA ##LL ##IED WITH A GIRL WHO HAD INDEED MANY CHAR ##MS STEP BY STEP HE HAD COME TO THE NECESS ##ITY OF SA ##CRI ##F ##IC ##ING HIS PRO ##S ##PECT ##S TO THAT RA ##W ATT ##ACH ##MENT
UN ##ABLE TO THINK OF WORK HE LEFT THE HOUSE AND WA ##NDER ##ED GL ##OOM ##ILY ABOUT REG ##ENT ' S PAR ##K
HE FELT HIMSELF ILL USED BY DEST ##IN ##Y AND THEREFORE BY MAR ##IAN WHO WAS FAT ##E ' S INST ##RU ##MENT
HE WR ##OTE TO MAR ##IAN
WILL YOU LET ME HEAR OR COME AND SEE ME
I SCARCE ##LY THOUGHT OF B ##IFF ##EN AS LIKE ##LY TO K ##ILL HIMSELF
BUT WHY THE DE ##U ##CE DID HE GO ALL THE WAY OUT THERE
I HOPE ##D YOU WOULD BRING ME SOME NEWS
PO ##VER ##TY I CAN ONLY SUPPOSE
BUT I WILL SEE WH ##EL ##P ##D ##ALE I HAD ##N ' T COME ACROSS B ##IFF ##EN FOR A LONG TIME
WAS HE STILL SO VERY POOR
ASKED AM ##Y COMP ##ASS ##ION ##ATELY
I ' M AFRAID SO HIS BOOK FA ##ILED UT ##TER ##LY
OH IF I HAD IMAG ##INED HIM STILL IN SUCH DIST ##RESS SURE ##LY I MIGHT HAVE DONE SOMETHING TO HELP HIM
PER ##CH ##ANCE HIS DEATH WAS IN PART ATT ##RIB ##UT ##ABLE TO THAT HOPE ##LESS LOVE
HE SENT ME A CO ##P ##Y OF HIS NO ##VEL SHE SAID AND I SAW HIM ONCE OR TW ##ICE AFTER THAT
HAVING THIS SUBJECT TO CONVERS ##E UPON PUT THE TWO MORE QUICKLY AT EAS ##E THAN COULD OTHER ##W ##ISE HAVE BEEN THE CASE
AM ##Y MIGHT TAKE A FORE ##MOST PLACE AMONG BR ##ILL ##IAN ##T WOMEN
ES ##PE ##CI ##ALLY NOW THAT HER FATHER IS THR ##E ##ATE ##NED WITH BL ##IND ##NESS
IS IT SO SER ##IOUS
EVEN IF MISTER Y ##UL ##E RECO ##VERS HIS SIGHT IT IS NOT AT ALL LIKE ##LY THAT HE WILL BE ABLE TO WORK AS BEFORE
OUR DIFFIC ##ULT ##IES ARE SO GRA ##VE THAT
HE PA ##USED AND LET HIS HAND FA ##IL DESP ##OND ##ENTLY
I HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF WILL YOU REMEMBER AND WHAT I HAVE SET MY MIND UPON NO DOUBT I SHALL SOME DAY AC ##H ##IE ##VE
THERE WAS SILENCE
THE LAST THREE YEARS HE CONTINUED HAVE MADE NO SLIGHT DIFFER ##ENCE IN MY POSITION
REC ##ALL WHERE I STOOD WHEN YOU FIRST KNEW ME
JUST NOW I AM IN NEED OF A LITTLE ENC ##OURA ##GE ##MENT
YOU DON ' T NOT ##ICE ANY FALL ##ING OFF IN MY WORK REC ##ENTLY
DO YOU SEE MY THINGS IN THE CUR ##REN ##T AND SO ON GENERAL ##LY
SOMETIMES I BELIEVE I HAVE DET ##ECT ##ED YOU WHEN THERE WAS NO SIGN ##AT ##URE
HER STORY IN THAT GIRLS PAPER HAS ATT ##RA ##CTED ATTENTION
AND I COULD SO EAS ##ILY PUT HER AT REST BY RE ##N ##OUN ##CING ALL CL ##A ##IM UPON HER
I SUR ##M ##ISE THAT THAT YOU YOURSELF WOULD ALSO BE PUT AT REST BY SUCH A DEC ##IS ##ION
DON ' T LOOK AT ME WITH THAT IR ##ON ##ICAL SMILE HE PLE ##ADE ##D
I COULD ##N ' T GO ABOUT DECL ##ARING THAT I WAS HEART ##BR ##OKEN IN ANY EVEN ##T I MUST BE CONT ##ENT FOR PEOPLE TO JUD ##GE ME ACCORD ##ING TO THEIR DISP ##OSITION AND JUD ##G ##MENTS ARE PRETTY SURE TO BE UN ##F ##AV ##OURA ##BLE WHAT CAN I DO
THE CASE IS TOO DEL ##IC ##ATE I FEAR FOR MY ADV ##ICE
WELL I ' LL GO BACK TO MY SC ##RIB ##B ##LING
AGAIN J ##ASP ##ER HELD THE WHITE SOFT HAND FOR A SUPER ##F ##L ##U ##OUS MOMENT
YET FOR SUCH FEELING ##S HE REP ##RO ##ACH ##ED HIMSELF AND THE REP ##RO ##ACH MADE HIM ANG ##RY
MAR ##IAN COULD NOT MIST ##AKE THE AIR OF REST ##LESS TROUBLE ON HER COMPAN ##ION ' S SM ##OO ##TH COUNT ##EN ##ANCE
SHE HAD DIV ##INED THAT THERE WAS SOME GRA ##VE REASON FOR THIS SUM ##M ##ONS AND THE PA ##N ##TING WITH WHICH SHE HAD APPROACH ##ED WAS HALF CAUSE ##D BY THE ANX ##IOUS BE ##ATS OF HER HEART
HE BEGAN AB ##RUPT ##LY
HE GAVE HER SUCH DET ##AIL ##S AS HE HAD OB ##TAINED THEN ADDED
THERE ARE TWO OF MY COMPAN ##IONS FALL ##EN IN THE BAT ##TLE
I OUGHT TO THINK MYSELF A LU ##CK ##Y FELLOW MAR ##IAN WHAT
YOU ARE BETTER F ##ITTED TO FIGHT YOUR WAY J ##ASP ##ER
MORE OF A BR ##UTE YOU MEAN
YOU KNOW VERY WELL I DON ' T
I HAVE MADE UP MY MIND ABOUT OUR AFF ##AIRS HE WENT ON PRESENT ##LY
YES
WILL YOU MAR ##RY ME AND LET US TAKE OUR CHANCE
YOU FEEL YOURSELF IND ##IS ##PE ##N ##S ##ABLE TO YOUR FATHER AT PRESENT
I SHOULD BE SO AFRAID OF THE EFFECT UPON HIS HEA ##LT ##H J ##ASP ##ER
SHE PA ##USED AND LOOKED UP AT HIM TOU ##CHING ##LY
DEAR I CAN ' T FEEL IT WOULD BE MY DUT ##Y TO RE ##N ##OUN ##CE YOU BECAUSE MY FATHER HAD BECOME BL ##IND
HAS ONE THING OCC ##UR ##RED TO YOU
WILL HE CONSE ##N ##T TO REC ##E ##IVE AN ALL ##OW ##ANCE FROM A PERSON WHOSE NAME IS MISSUS MIL ##V ##AIN
AND IF HE OBS ##T ##IN ##ATELY REF ##USE ##S WHAT THEN WHAT IS BEFORE HIM
SHE LIST ##ENED ANX ##IOUSLY AND REF ##LE ##CTED
AS I HAVE SAID THERE IS THE VERY SER ##IOUS DOUBT WHETHER YOUR FATHER WOULD ACCEPT MONEY FROM YOU WHEN YOU ARE MY WIFE
IT IS ##N ' T YOUR FA ##ULT MAR ##IAN AND WELL THEN THERE ' S ONLY ONE THING TO DO
EXCEPT J ##ASP ##ER THAT IF FATHER IS HELP ##LESS I MUST FIND MEANS OF ASS ##URING HIS SUPP ##ORT
DO YOU THINK THEM INS ##UR ##M ##OUNT ##ABLE
THAT IS JUST WHAT I HAVE DEC ##IDED IS IMPOSS ##IBLE MAR ##IAN YOU SHALL HAVE THE PLAIN TRUTH
I DON ' T TR ##UST MYSELF
BUT SHALL YOU FACE THEM WILL ##INGLY
PUT UP YOUR U ##MB ##RE ##LL ##A MAR ##IAN
WHAT DO I CARE FOR A DRO ##P OF RA ##IN SHE EXCLAIMED WITH PASS ##ION ##ATE SAD ##NESS WHEN ALL MY LIFE IS AT ST ##AKE HOW AM I TO UNDERSTAND YOU
EVERY WORD YOU SPEAK SEEMS INT ##END ##ED TO DIS ##H ##EAR ##TEN ME
WHY NEED YOU CON ##CE ##AL IT IF THAT IS THE TRUTH
IS THAT WHAT YOU MEAN BY SAYING YOU DIST ##RU ##ST YOURSELF
WE MUST SEE EACH OTHER AGAIN MAR ##IAN
HOW AM I TO LIVE AN HOUR IN SUCH UNC ##ERTAIN ##TY AS THIS
I DO WISH IT
HER EM ##OT ##ION HAD AN EFFECT UPON HIM AND HIS VOICE TRE ##MB ##LED
THERE IS NO NATURAL LAW THAT A CHILD SHOULD SUR ##REN ##DER EVERYTHING FOR HER PAR ##ENTS
YOU KNOW SO MUCH MORE OF THE WORLD THAN I DO CAN ' T YOU ADV ##ISE ME
IS THERE NO WAY OF PROV ##ID ##ING FOR MY FATHER
GOOD GOD THIS IS FRIGHT ##FUL MAR ##IAN I CAN ' T STAND IT
I WILL BE FAITH ##FUL TO YOU
HE HAD MADE A PRET ##ENCE OF HOLD ##ING HIS U ##MB ##RE ##LL ##A OVER HER BUT MAR ##IAN TURNED AWAY AND WALKED TO A LITTLE DISTANCE AND STOOD BENE ##ATH THE SHE ##LT ##ER OF A GREAT TREE HER FACE AV ##ERT ##ED FROM HIM
MO ##VING TO FOLLOW HE SAW THAT HER FR ##AME WAS SH ##AKEN BY SOUND ##LESS SO ##B ##B ##ING
IN WHAT CAN THERE BE MORE SELF ##ISH ##NESS
BUT I COULD ##N ' T SAY A WORD THAT WOULD SEEM TO INV ##ITE SUCH MIS ##ERY AS THIS
YOU DON ' T LOVE ME J ##ASP ##ER AND THAT ' S AN END OF EVERYTHING
HAPP ##INESS OR MIS ##ERY COME TO US BY FAT ##E
IS IT IN MY POWER TO MAKE YOU HAPPY
BUT IF YOU HAD SAID YOU LOVED ME BEFORE THAT I SHOULD HAVE IT ALWAYS TO REMEMBER
IF I BELIEVE ANYTHING I BELIEVE THAT I DID LOVE YOU
WHAT CAN YOU SAY TO ME MORE THAN YOU HAVE SAID NOW
REMEMBER ME AS A MAN WHO DIS ##RE ##GAR ##DE ##D PR ##ICE ##LESS LOVE SUCH AS YOUR ##S TO GO AND MAKE HIMSELF A PRO ##UD POSITION AMONG FOOL ##S AND KN ##AVE ##S INDEED THAT ' S WHAT IT COMES TO
SOON ENOUGH YOU WOULD TH ##OR ##OUGH ##LY DESP ##ISE ME AND THOUGH I SHOULD KNOW IT WAS MER ##ITED MY PER ##VERS ##E PR ##IDE WOULD REV ##OL ##T AGAINST IT
WHAT CAN BE SIM ##PLE ##R THAN THE TRUTH
IT IS A THING THAT HAPP ##ENS EVERY DAY EITHER IN MAN OR WOMAN AND ALL THAT HON ##OUR DEM ##AND ##S IS THE COUR ##AGE TO CONF ##ESS THE TRUTH
MAR ##IAN WILL YOU DO THIS WILL YOU LET OUR ENG ##AGE ##MENT LAST FOR ANOTHER SIX MONTH ##S BUT WITHOUT OUR MEET ##ING DURING THAT TIME
THAT SEEMS TO ME CHILD ##ISH
THE RA ##IN FELL UNC ##E ##AS ##INGLY AND WITH IT BEGAN TO MIN ##G ##LE AN A ##UT ##UM ##N ##AL MIST
J ##ASP ##ER DEL ##AY ##ED A MOMENT THEN ASKED CAL ##M ##LY
ARE YOU GOING TO THE MUS ##E ##UM YES
GO HOME AGAIN FOR THIS MORNING MAR ##IAN YOU CAN ' T WORK
I MUST AND I HAVE NO TIME TO LO ##SE
GOOD BY ##E SHE GAVE HIM HER HAND
THEY LOOKED AT EACH OTHER FOR AN INST ##ANT THEN MAR ##IAN LEFT THE SHE ##LT ##ER OF THE TREE OPENED HER U ##MB ##RE ##LL ##A AND WALKED QUICKLY AWAY
J ##ASP ##ER DID NOT WATCH HER HE HAD THE FACE OF A MAN WHO IS SUFF ##ERING A SEVER ##E HUM ##IL ##IA ##T ##ION
HIS SISTER SAID VERY LITTLE FOR SHE RECO ##GN ##ISED GEN ##U ##INE SUFF ##ERING IN HIS TONE ##S AND AS ##PECT
A FEW WEE ##KS AGO HE ACT ##UALLY PROP ##OSED TO A WOMAN FOR WHOM HE DOES NOT PRET ##END TO HAVE THE SLIGHT ##EST AFF ##ECT ##ION BUT WHO IS VERY RICH AND WHO SEEMED LIKE ##LY TO BE FOOL ##ISH ENOUGH TO MAR ##RY HIM
YES ##TER ##DAY MORNING HE RECEIVED HER FIN ##AL ANSWER A REF ##US ##AL
YOU WILL UNDERSTAND THOUGH SURE ##LY YOU NEED NO FRE ##SH PRO ##O ##F HOW UT ##TER ##LY UN ##W ##ORT ##H ##Y HE IS OF YOU
YOU ARE THE ONLY FRIEND I HAVE OF MY OWN SE ##X AND I COULD NOT BEAR TO LO ##SE YOU
SEVERAL DAYS PASSED BEFORE THERE CAME A REP ##LY
I MUST ONLY ASK THAT YOU WILL WR ##ITE TO ME WITHOUT THE LEAST REF ##ERE ##N ##CE TO THESE TROUBLE ##S TELL ME ALWAYS ABOUT YOURSELF AND BE SURE THAT YOU CANNOT TELL ME TOO MUCH
WE HAD THEN BUT LITTLE OF THAT MIN ##UTE AND ACC ##UR ##ATE KNOWLEDGE OF THE INTER ##IOR OF THE CONTIN ##ENT WHICH WAS REQU ##IS ##ITE FOR A DETERM ##INATION OF THE PROB ##LE ##M
SEVERAL DIFFERENT PART ##IES WERE THEREFORE OR ##G ##AN ##IZED TO EXAM ##INE THE VAR ##IOUS RO ##UTES SUPPOSE ##D TO BE PRACT ##IC ##ABLE WITHIN THE NORTH ##ERN AND SOUTH ##ERN LIM ##ITS OF THE UN ##ITED STATE ##S
THE ONLY DISC ##RI ##M ##INATION MADE WAS IN THE MORE PROM ##PT AND TH ##OR ##OUGH EQU ##IP ##MENT OF THE PART ##IES FOR THE EXT ##RE ##ME NORTH ##ERN LINE AND THIS WAS ONLY BECAUSE THAT WAS SUPPOSE ##D TO BE THE MOST DIFFIC ##ULT OF EX ##E ##C ##UTION OF ALL THE SUR ##VE ##YS
INQU ##IR ##IES WERE MADE WITH REGARD TO GU ##N ##P ##OW ##DER WHICH SUB ##SE ##QU ##ENTLY LED TO THE USE OF A CO ##ARS ##ER GRA ##IN FOR ART ##ILL ##ERY
THE OFFIC ##ERS OF THESE REG ##IMENT ##S WERE CH ##OSE ##N PART ##LY BY SE ##LE ##CTION FROM THOSE ALREADY IN SERV ##ICE IN THE REG ##ULAR ARM ##Y AND PART ##LY BY APP ##OINT ##MENT FROM C ##IV ##IL LIFE
UNDER INST ##RU ##CTION ##S FROM THE PRES ##IDENT THE LIST WAS THEREFORE REV ##ISED AND MO ##D ##IFIED IN ACCORD ##ANCE WITH THIS NEW ELE ##MENT OF GE ##OG ##RA ##PH ##ICAL DIST ##RIB ##UTION
AFTER SOME FURTHER DISC ##USS ##ION OF THE QUESTION THE VISIT ##ORS WITH ##D ##REW DIS ##S ##AT ##ISF ##IED WITH THE RES ##ULT OF THE INTER ##V ##IEW
THE QUAR ##TER ##MA ##STER GENERAL ON HEAR ##ING OF THIS CONVERS ##ATION HAST ##ENED TO INFORM ME THAT IT WAS ALL A MIST ##AKE THAT THE APP ##OINT ##EE TO THE OFFIC ##E HAD BEEN CONF ##OUNDED WITH HIS FATHER WHO WAS A WELL KNOWN WH ##IG BUT THAT HE THE SON WAS A DEM ##OC ##RA ##T

WELL I ' M A RICH MAN NOW AND SO IS MY MAT ##E M ##C LAUGH ##L ##IN FOR THAT WOOD WAS CONTR ##ACT ##ED FOR BY THE LARGE ##ST AND RICH ##EST P ##IAN ##O FIR ##M IN THIS COUNTRY AND NOW IT IS ALL BUT DEL ##IVER ##ED TO THEM AND THE MONEY IN OUR HANDS

MAY ##BE AUNT EM ##ILY WILL TAKE YOU DOWN TO THE CITY ON HER SHO ##PPING TOU ##R SUGG ##ESTED N ##AN
HE MADE THE CLE ##R ##KS REM ##OVE ALL THE TR ##UCK FROM THE A ##IS ##LES AND I GU ##ESS EVERY ##BODY WAS GLAD THE ARM ##Y FELL DOWN
THE WONDER ##FUL FRE ##SH AIR THAT THESE MEN LIVED IN NIGHT AND DAY HAD BRIGHT ##ENED THEIR EYES TOO SO THAT EVEN THE PLAIN ##EST FACE AND THE MOST AW ##K ##WARD MAN AMONG THEM WAS AS N ##IM ##BLE AS AN AT ##H ##LE ##TE FROM HIS PERFECT EX ##ER ##CI ##SE
I DON ' T KNOW HOW TO SAY GOOD BY TO YOU NE ##LL ##IE TOLD DO ##RO ##TH ##Y AND N ##AN NEXT MORNING

MOST OF THEM I GU ##ESS ANSWERED BE ##R ##T
WELL WE HAVE HAD A GOOD V ##AC ##ATION AND I AM WILL ##ING TO GO TO WORK AGAIN
SO AM I DECL ##ARED N ##AN V ##AC ##ATION WAS JUST LONG ENOUGH I THINK
MISTER BO ##B ##BS ##EY WAS DOWN FROM THE CITY OF COURSE TO TAKE THE FAMILY HOME AND NOW ALL HANDS EVEN FRE ##D ##D ##IE AND FLO ##S ##S ##IE WERE BUS ##Y PA ##CK ##ING UP
THERE WERE THE SHE ##LL ##S TO BE LOOKED AFTER THE FISH NE ##TS BESIDES DOWN ##Y THE DU ##CK AND SN ##OO ##P THE CAT

IF DO ##ST ##O ##E ##V ##S ##K ##Y HAD HAD LESS VIS ##ION HE WOULD HAVE BEEN STRI ##ND ##BER ##G

CERTAINLY THE LU ##ST OF CR ##UE ##LT ##Y THE LU ##ST OF DEST ##RU ##CTION FOR DEST ##RU ##CTION ' S SA ##KE IS THE MOST CONS ##P ##IC ##U ##OUS OF THE DEAD ##LY S ##INS IN DO ##ST ##O ##E ##V ##S ##K ##Y ' S MEN AND WOMEN
HE MAY NOT BE A CR ##UE ##L AUTHOR

EVEN THE LU ##ST IS NEVER OR HARDLY EVER THE LU ##ST OF A MORE OR LESS SA ##NE MAN
DO ##ST ##O ##E ##V ##S ##K ##Y COULD NOT HAVE DES ##CRIB ##ED THE S ##IN OF NE ##K ##H ##L ##UD ##OV IN RES ##UR ##RE ##CTION
THIS IS A MAD ##H ##OUSE CR ##IES SOME ONE IN THE I ##D ##I ##OT
ONE RES ##ULT OF THIS IS A MU ##LT ##IP ##LIC ##ITY OF ACT ##ION
EVEN THE TALK IS OF ACT ##IONS MORE THAN OF IDEA ##S
HE SO ##W ##S VI ##OL ##ENT DE ##ED ##S NOT WITH THE HAND BUT WITH THE SA ##CK
BUT ONE HAD NOT ##ICED DURING THOSE LAST TWO DAYS THAT THE OTHER WAS WE ##ARING A SIL ##VER WATCH ON A YE ##LLOW BE ##AD CH ##AIN WHICH HE SEEMS NOT TO HAVE SEEN ON HIM BEFORE
HE TOOK A KN ##IFE AND WHEN HIS FRIEND HAD TURNED AWAY HE APPROACH ##ED HIM CA ##UT ##IOUSLY FROM BEHIND TOOK A ##IM TURNED HIS EYES HEAVEN ##WARDS CROSS ##ED HIMSELF AND PRAY ##ING FE ##R ##VENT ##LY GOD FORG ##IVE ME FOR CHRIST ' S SA ##KE
HE NEVER PAIN ##TS EVERY ##MAN HE ALWAYS PRO ##JECT ##S DO ##ST ##O ##E ##V ##S ##K ##Y OR A NIGHT ##MA ##RE OF DO ##ST ##O ##E ##V ##S ##K ##Y

WE SY ##M ##P ##ATH ##IZE INDEED WITH THE FEAR ##S THE BRA ##V ##AD ##O THE DESP ##AIR THAT SUCC ##EE ##D THE CR ##IME
HE IS A GR ##OTE ##S ##QU ##E MADE AL ##IVE BY SHE ##ER IMAG ##IN ##ATIVE INT ##ENS ##ITY AND PASS ##ION

MISTER MUR ##RY BO ##LD ##LY FACE ##S THE DIFFIC ##ULT ##Y AND ATTEMPT ##S THE DEF ##IN ##ITION
TO HIM DO ##ST ##O ##E ##V ##S ##K ##Y ' S WORK IS THE RECO ##R ##D OF A GREAT MIND SEE ##KING FOR A WAY OF LIFE IT IS MORE THAN A RECO ##R ##D OF STR ##UGG ##LE IT IS THE STR ##UGG ##LE ITSELF

THIS IS ALL IN A ME ##AS ##URE TRUE
TO SAY THIS IS NOT TO DEN ##Y THE SPIRIT ##UAL CONT ##ENT OF DO ##ST ##O ##E ##V ##S ##K ##Y ' S WORK THE ANG ##U ##ISH OF THE IMP ##RI ##SON ##ED SOUL AS IT BAT ##TLE ##S WITH DOUBT AND DEN ##IAL AND DESP ##AIR

THE U ##LT ##IM ##ATE ATT ##ITUDE OF DO ##ST ##O ##E ##V ##S ##K ##Y IS AS CHRIST ##IAN AS THE AP ##OST ##LE PE ##TER ' S LORD I BELIEVE HELP THOU MINE UN ##BE ##L ##IEF

HIS WORK LIKE HIS FACE BEAR ##S THE MAR ##K OF THIS TERRI ##BLE CONF ##LIC ##T
THE NO ##VEL ##S ARE THE PERFECT IMAG ##E OF THE MAN
AS TO THE MAN HIMSELF THE VI ##CO ##M ##TE DE VO ##G ##UE ##E DES ##CRIB ##ED HIM AS HE SAW HIM IN THE LAST YEARS OF HIS LIFE
WHEN HE BECAME EXC ##ITED ON A CERTAIN POINT ONE COULD HAVE SW ##ORN THAT ONE HAD SEEN HIM BEFORE SEA ##TED ON A BE ##N ##CH IN A POL ##ICE COURT AW ##A ##ITING TRI ##AL OR AMONG V ##AG ##AB ##OND ##S WHO PASSED THEIR TIME BEG ##GING BEFORE THE PRISON DOOR ##S
AT ALL OTHER TIMES HE CARRIED THAT LOOK OF SAD AND GENTLE ME ##E ##K ##NESS SEEN ON THE IMAG ##ES OF OLD SLA ##V ##ON ##IC SAINT ##S
THAT IS THE PORT ##RA ##IT OF THE MAN ONE SEE ##S BEHIND DO ##ST ##O ##E ##V ##S ##K ##Y ' S NO ##VEL ##S A PORT ##RA ##IT ONE MIGHT ALMOST HAVE INF ##ER ##RED FROM THE NO ##VEL ##S
IT IS A FIG ##URE THAT AT ONCE FA ##S ##CI ##N ##ATES AND REPE ##LS
HE IS NOT BY TEM ##PER ##AME ##N ##T A SING ##ER
HIS MUS ##IC IS A STILL SMALL VOICE UN ##E ##VEN ##LY MAT ##CHED AGAINST HIS CONS ##CIOUS ##NESS OF MID ##N ##IGHT AND STO ##R ##M
TRUTH TO TELL MISTER HARD ##Y IS NEITHER SUFF ##IC ##IENT ##LY ART ##IC ##UL ##ATE NOR SUFF ##IC ##IENT ##LY FAST ##ID ##IOUS TO BE A GREAT PO ##ET
HE DOES NOT EXPRESS LIFE EAS ##ILY IN BEAUTIFUL WORDS OR IN IMAG ##ES
THUS HE WR ##ITE ##S IN I FOUND HER OUT THERE OF ONE WHO
THERE COULD NOT BE AN U ##G ##L ##IER AND MORE PRO ##S ##A ##IC EX ##AG ##GER ##ATION THAN IS CONT ##AINED IN THE IMAG ##E IN THE LAST LINE
AND PRO ##SE INT ##RU ##DE ##S IN THE CH ##O ##ICE OF WORDS AS WELL AS IN IMAG ##ES
TAKE FOR EXAM ##PLE THE USE OF THE WORD DO ##M ##IC ##ILED IN THE PASS ##AGE IN THE SAME PO ##EM ABOUT
WHEN WE AS STRANGE ##R ##S SOU ##GHT THEIR CAT ##ERING CARE VE ##ILED SMILE ##S BES ##P ##OKE THEIR THOUGHT OF WHAT WE WERE
CAT ##ERING CARE IS AN APP ##ALL ##ING PH ##RA ##SE
IS A LINE OF GOOD PO ##ET ##RY
YOU DID NOT COME AND MAR ##CHING TIME DREW ON AND WOR ##E ME NUM ##B YET LESS FOR LO ##S ##S OF YOUR DEAR PRES ##ENCE THERE THAN THAT I THUS FOUND LA ##CK ##ING IN YOUR MAKE THAT HIGH COMP ##ASS ##ION WHICH CAN OVER ##BE ##AR REL ##UCT ##ANCE FOR PUR ##E LO ##VING KIND ##NESS SA ##KE GR ##IE ##VED I WHEN AS THE HOPE HOUR STR ##OKE ##D ITS SUM YOU DID NOT COME
THERE ARE H ##INT ##S OF THE GRAND ST ##Y ##LE OF L ##Y ##RIC PO ##ET ##RY IN THESE LINE ##S BUT PH ##RA ##SE ##S LIKE IN YOUR MAKE AND AS THE HOPE HOUR STR ##OKE ##D ITS SUM ARE DISC ##ORD ##S THAT BRING IT T ##UMB ##LING TO THE LE ##VEL ##S OF VICT ##OR ##IAN COMMON ##PL ##ACE
HE HAS A TEM ##PER ##AME ##N ##T SENS ##IT ##IVE BEYOND THAT OF ALL BUT A FEW REC ##ENT WR ##ITER ##S TO THE PAIN AND PASS ##ION OF HUMAN BEING ##S
ONE CAN REMEMBER PO ##EM AFTER PO ##EM OF HIS WITH A THEM ##E THAT MIGHT EAS ##ILY HAVE SERV ##ED FOR MISTER HARD ##Y TOO LATE CR ##IST ##IN ##A THE LOST MIST ##RESS THE LAST RID ##E TOGETHER THE ST ##AT ##UE AND THE BUS ##T TO NAME A FEW
BUT WHAT A SENSE OF TRI ##UMP ##H THERE IS IN BROWN ##ING ' S TRA ##GED ##IES
HIS WORLD IS A PLACE OF OP ##UL ##ENCE NOT OF PO ##VER ##TY
TO HAVE LOVED EVEN FOR AN HOUR IS WITH BROWN ##ING TO LIVE FOR EVER AFTER IN THE IN ##HER ##IT ##ANCE OF A MIGHT ##Y AC ##H ##IE ##VE ##MENT
TO HAVE LOVED FOR AN HOUR IS IN MISTER HARD ##Y ' S IMAG ##INATION TO HAVE DEEP ##ENED THE SAD ##NESS EVEN MORE THAN THE BEAUTY OF ONE ' S MEM ##OR ##IES
FOR THEN I UN ##D ##IST ##RES ##T BY HEART ##S GR ##OWN COLD TO ME COULD LO ##NE ##LY WAIT MY END ##LESS REST WITH EQU ##AN ##IM ##ITY

WE PICT ##URED THE ME ##E ##K MIL ##D CREAT ##URES WHERE THEY D ##W ##EL ##T IN THEIR STRA ##W ##Y PEN NOR DID IT OCC ##UR TO ONE OF US THERE TO DOUBT THEY WERE KN ##EE ##LING THEN
THE MO ##OD OF FAITH HOWEVER OR RATHER OF DELIGHT IN THE MEM ##ORY OF FAITH IS NOT MISTER HARD ##Y ' S PRE ##V ##AIL ##ING MO ##OD
HE CAN ENTER UPON A WAR WITHOUT IR ##ON ##ICAL DOUBT ##S AS WE SEE IN THE SON ##G MEN WHO MAR ##CH AWAY
HOW LONG HE CR ##IES IN A PO ##EM WR ##ITT ##EN SOME YEARS AGO
WHEN SHALL THE SA ##NER SOFT ##ER POL ##ITIES WHERE ##O ##F WE DREAM HAVE SW ##AY IN EACH PRO ##UD LAND AND PAT ##RI ##OT ##ISM GR ##OWN GOD ##L ##IKE SC ##ORN TO STAND BO ##ND ##S ##LA ##VE TO REAL ##MS BUT CIRC ##LE EARTH AND SEA ##S
BUT PERHAPS HIS CHARACTER ##IST ##IC ATT ##ITUDE TO WAR IS TO BE FOUND NOT IN LINE ##S LIKE THESE BUT IN THAT ME ##LA ##N ##CH ##OL ##Y PO ##EM THE SOUL ##S OF THE SLA ##IN IN WHICH THE SOUL ##S OF THE DEAD SOLD ##IERS RETURN TO THEIR COUNTRY AND QUESTION A SE ##N ##IOR SOUL FL ##AME AS TO HOW THEIR FRIENDS AND REL ##ATIVE ##S HAVE KEPT THEIR DO ##UGHT ##Y DE ##ED ##S IN REM ##EM ##BR ##ANCE
AND GENERAL HOW HOLD OUT OUR SWEET ##H ##EAR ##TS SW ##ORN LO ##Y ##AL AS DO ##VES
SOME F ##ICK ##LE AND FLE ##ET HEART ##S HAVE FOUND THEM NEW LOVE ##S
AND OUR W ##IVES QU ##OTH ANOTHER RES ##IGN ##ED ##LY D ##W ##ELL THEY ON OUR DE ##ED ##S
MISTER HARD ##Y HAS TOO BIT ##TER A SENSE OF REAL ##ITY TO BELIEVE MUCH IN THE GL ##ORY OF WAR
THE REAL WORLD TO MISTER HARD ##Y IS THE WORLD OF AN ##CIENT HUMAN THINGS IN WHICH WAR HAS COME TO BE A H ##IDE ##OUS IR ##RE ##LE ##V ##ANCE
IT MAY BE THOUGHT ON THE OTHER HAND THAT MISTER HARD ##Y ' S PO ##EM ##S ABOUT WAR ARE NO MORE EXPRESS ##IVE OF TRA ##G ##IC F ##UT ##ILITY THAN HIS PO ##EM ##S ABOUT LOVE
F ##UT ##ILITY AND FR ##UST ##RA ##T ##ION ARE EVER REC ##UR ##RI ##NG THEM ##ES IN BOTH
HIS LOVE ##R ##S LIKE HIS SOLD ##IERS RO ##T IN THE GRA ##VE DEF ##E ##ATED OF THEIR GL ##ORY
LOVE ##R ##S ARE ALWAYS SEVER ##ED BOTH IN LIFE AND IN DEATH
IN BEYOND THE LAST LA ##M ##P WE HAVE THE SAME MO ##URN ##FUL CRY OVER SEVER ##ANCE
NO SHAD ##E OF P ##IN ##N ##AC ##LE OR TREE OR TO ##W ##ER WHILE EARTH END ##URES WILL FALL ON MY MO ##UND AND WITHIN THE HOUR STE ##AL ON TO YOUR ##S ONE ROB ##IN NEVER HA ##UNT OUR TWO GREEN COVER ##T ##URES
THEY BRING US FACE TO FACE WITH AN EXPER ##IENCE INT ##ENSE ##R THAN OUR OWN
NOTHING OF T ##IN ##IEST WORTH HAVE I WR ##OUGHT PO ##NDER ##ED PLAN ##NED NO ONE THING ASK ##ING BLA ##ME OR PR ##A ##ISE SINCE THE PAL ##E COR ##PS ##E LIKE B ##IRT ##H OF THIS D ##I ##URN ##AL UN ##IT BEAR ##ING BLA ##N ##KS IN ALL ITS RA ##YS DU ##LL ##EST OF DU ##LL H ##UED DAYS
IT ' S A SAD THING FOR A BODY TO LA ##CK BRA ##INS WHEN SHE WANT ##S TO BE A TE ##ACH ##ER IS ##N ' T IT
PEN ##EL ##OP ##E HAS STUD ##IED SO HARD ALL WIN ##TER AND SHE HAS ##N ' T GONE ANY ##WHERE THOUGHT THE OLD ##ER SISTER W ##IST ##FULLY
DO ##RI ##S DREAM ##ED OF PRETTY DRESS ##ES ALL THAT NIGHT AND THOUGHT ABOUT THEM ALL THE NEXT DAY
SO IT MUST BE CONF ##ESSED DID PEN ##EL ##OP ##E THOUGH SHE WOULD NOT HAVE ADM ##ITTED IT FOR THE WORLD
SHE KNEW THAT PEN ##EL ##OP ##E HAD START ##ED OUT TO SAY A NEW DRESS
DO ##RI ##S H ##UNT ##ER I BELIEVE IT ' S AN OLD QU ##ILT

YOUR AFF ##ECT ##ION ##ATE AUNT AD ##ELL ##A H ##UNT ##ER
I DON ' T SEE ITS BEAUTY SAID PEN ##EL ##OP ##E WITH A GR ##IM ##ACE
IT MAY HAVE BEEN PRETTY ONCE BUT IT IS ALL FA ##DE ##D NOW
TELL ME DO ##R ##RIE DOES IT AR ##G ##UE A LA ##CK OF PROPER RESPECT FOR MY AN ##CES ##TO ##R ##S THAT I CAN ' T FEEL VERY ENT ##H ##US ##IA ##ST ##IC OVER THIS HE ##IRL ##OOM ES ##PE ##CI ##ALLY WHEN GRAND ##M ##OTHER H ##UNT ##ER DIED YEARS BEFORE I WAS BORN
IT WAS VERY KIND OF AUNT AD ##ELL ##A TO SEND IT SAID DO ##RI ##S DUT ##IFUL ##LY
WHY THE WRONG SIDE IS EVER SO MUCH PRET ##T ##IER THAN THE RIGHT EXCLAIMED PEN ##EL ##OP ##E
WHAT LOVE ##LY OLD TIME ##Y ST ##UFF AND NOT A BIT FA ##DE ##D
I DECL ##ARE IT IS AS GOOD AS NEW
WELL LET US GO AND HAVE TE ##A SAID PEN ##EL ##OP ##E I ' M DEC ##IDED ##LY HUNG ##RY
BESIDES I SEE THE PO ##VER ##TY P ##UCK ##ER COMING
IT IS SOMETHING TO POSS ##ESS AN HE ##IRL ##OOM AFTER ALL
PEN ##EL ##OP ##E WAS SURPR ##ISED AS MUCH AS THE TEN ##DER SISTER ##LY HEART COULD WISH WHEN DO ##RI ##S FL ##ASH ##ED OUT UPON HER TRI ##UMP ##H ##ANTLY ON THE EVENING OF THE PARTY WITH THE BLACK SK ##IRT N ##ICE ##LY PRES ##SE ##D AND RE HUNG AND THE PRET ##T ##IEST WA ##IST IMAG ##IN ##ABLE A WA ##IST THAT WAS A PO ##S ##IT ##IVE CREAT ##ION OF DA ##INT ##Y ROSE BES ##PR ##INK ##LED SIL ##K WITH A GI ##R ##DLE AND KN ##OTS OF BLACK VE ##L ##VE ##T
SO PEN ##EL ##OP ##E WENT TO BLA ##N ##CH ##E ' S PARTY AND HER DRESS WAS THE ADM ##IR ##ATION OF EVERY GIRL THERE
PEN ##EL ##OP ##E THOUGHT HER AL ##TO ##GETHER CHAR ##MING
SHE LOOK ##S AS IF SHE HAD JUST STEP ##PE ##D OUT OF THE FR ##AME OF SOME LOVE ##LY OLD PICT ##URE SHE SAID TO HERSELF
MY AUNT AD ##ELL ##A GAVE ME GAVE US THE MAT ##ER ##IAL SHE ST ##AM ##MER ##ED
I AM NAME ##D AFTER HER MISSUS FAIR ##W ##E ##ATHER SUDDENLY PUT HER ARM ABOUT PEN ##EL ##OP ##E AND DREW THE YOUNG GIRL TO HER HER LOVE ##LY OLD FACE AG ##L ##OW WITH DELIGHT AND TEN ##DER ##NESS
THEN YOU ARE MY GRAND ##N ##IE ##CE SHE SAID
WHEN I SAW YOUR DRESS I FELT SURE YOU WERE REL ##ATED TO HER I SHOULD RECO ##GN ##IZE THAT ROSE ##B ##UD SIL ##K IF I CAME ACROSS IT IN TH ##IB ##ET
PEN ##EL ##OP ##E WAS FOUR YEARS OLD ##ER THAN I WAS BUT WE WERE DEV ##OTE ##D TO EACH OTHER
SOON AFTER THIS OUR MOTHER DIED AND OUR HOUSE ##H ##OLD WAS BR ##OKEN UP
MY DEAR I AM A VERY LO ##NE ##LY OLD WOMAN WITH NO ##BODY BELONG ##ING TO ME
NOW SHE PAT ##TED MISSUS FAIR ##W ##E ##ATHER ' S SOFT OLD HAND AFF ##ECT ##ION ##ATELY
DO ##RI ##S AND PEN ##EL ##OP ##E FOUND THEIR LIVE ##S AND PLAN ##S CHANGE ##D IN THE TW ##INK ##LING OF AN EYE
WHEN MISSUS FAIR ##W ##E ##ATHER HAD GONE DO ##RI ##S AND PEN ##EL ##OP ##E LOOKED AT EACH OTHER
AS SHE SL ##IP ##PE ##D INTO HER BLUE PRIN ##T AFTER ##N ##OON DRESS HER AUNT CALLED TO HER FROM BEL ##OW
AUNT J ##ANE WAS STANDING AT THE FOOT OF THE ST ##AIRS WITH A LA ##M ##P IN ONE HAND AND A YEAR OLD BAB ##Y CL ##ING ##ING TO THE OTHER
SHE WAS A BIG SH ##APE ##LESS WOMAN WITH A ROUND GOOD NATURE ##D FACE CHE ##ER ##FUL AND V ##UL ##GAR AS A SUN ##F ##L ##OWER WAS AUNT J ##ANE AT ALL TIMES AND OCCASION ##S
I WANT TO RUN OVER AND SEE HOW MISSUS BR ##IX ##BY IS THIS EVENING S ##ID ##DY AND YOU MUST TAKE CARE OF THE BAB ##Y TILL I GET BACK
S ##ID ##NEY S ##IGH ##ED AND WENT DOWN ##ST ##AIRS FOR THE BAB ##Y
ALL HER DAYS WERE AL ##IKE AS FAR AS HARD WORK AND DU ##LL ##NESS WENT BUT SHE ACCEPT ##ED THEM CHE ##ER ##FULLY AND UNC ##OM ##PL ##AIN ##INGLY
BUT SHE DID RES ##ENT HAVING TO LOOK AFTER THE BAB ##Y WHEN SHE WANTED TO WR ##ITE HER LETTER
THE ROOM WAS SMALL A MERE BOX ABOVE THE K ##ITCH ##EN WHICH S ##ID ##NEY SHAR ##ED WITH TWO SMALL CO ##US ##INS
HER BED AND THE CO ##T WHERE THE LITTLE GIRLS SLE ##PT FILLED UP ALMOST ALL THE AV ##AIL ##ABLE SP ##ACE
JUST AT THAT PARTICULAR ANG ##LE ONE EYE APPEARED TO BE AS LARGE AS AN OR ##ANGE WHILE THE OTHER WAS THE S ##IZE OF A PE ##A AND THE MOUTH Z ##IG ##Z ##AG ##GED FROM EAR TO EAR
S ##ID ##NEY HAT ##ED THAT M ##IR ##RO ##R AS VI ##RU ##LE ##N ##T ##LY AS SHE COULD HAT ##E ANYTHING
HER MOTHER HAD DIED THE DAY AFTER AND S ##ID ##NEY THERE ##UP ##ON HAD COME INTO THE HANDS OF GOOD AUNT J ##ANE WITH THOSE BOOK ##S FOR HER DO ##W ##RY SINCE NOTHING ELSE WAS LEFT AFTER THE EXP ##ENSE ##S OF THE DOUB ##LE F ##UNE ##RA ##L HAD BEEN PA ##ID
PRESENT ##LY SHE BEGAN TO WR ##ITE WITH A FL ##USH OF REAL EXC ##ITE ##MENT ON HER FACE
ONLY ONE ANSWER CAME TO EL ##LE ##N DO ##UG ##LA ##S AND THAT WAS FORWARD ##ED TO HER BY THE LONG SUFF ##ERING ED ##IT ##OR OF THE MA ##PLE LEA ##F
HE WR ##OTE THAT ALTHOUGH HIS AGE DE ##B ##ARR ##ED HIM FROM MEM ##BER ##SHIP IN THE CL ##UB HE WAS TWENTY AND THE LIM ##IT WAS EIGHTEEN HE READ THE LETTER ##S OF THE DEP ##ART ##MENT WITH MUCH INTEREST AND OFTEN HAD THOUGHT OF ANSWER ##ING SOME OF THE REQU ##EST ##S FOR COR ##RES ##P ##OND ##ENTS

WOULD SHE BE KIND ENOUGH TO COR ##RES ##P ##OND WITH HIM
HE WAS TWO YEARS OUT FROM THE EAS ##T AND HAD NOT YET FORGOT ##TEN TO BE HOME ##S ##ICK AT TIMES
S ##ID ##NEY LIKE ##D THE LETTER AND ANSWERED IT
SHE NEVER EXPECT ##ED TO MEET JOHN LI ##N ##CO ##L ##N NOR DID SHE WISH TO DO SO

AS HE KNEW HIS BUSINESS AND AS THE CAL ##F WAS A SMALL ONE THE LITTLE BE ##AST WENT OVER PROM ##PT ##LY BIT THE GROUND WITH A WH ##ACK AND WAS PO ##UN ##CED UPON AND HELD

YOU CAN IMAG ##INE WHAT HAPPENED NEXT
THIS IS PRODU ##CT ##IVE OF SOME F ##UN IF IT FA ##ILS

SOMETIMES THREE OR FOUR CAL ##VES WERE ON THE GROUND AT ONCE

FIN ##ALLY WOOD ##EN DISCOVER ##ED IT IN HIS H ##IP POCK ##ET
THEY HAD BEEN DOING A WR ##EST ##LER ' S HEAVY WORK ALL THE MORNING BUT DID NOT SEEM TO BE T ##IRED
I SAW ONCE IN SOME CRA ##N ##K PH ##YS ##ICAL C ##ULT ##URE PER ##I ##OD ##ICAL THAT A CO ##W ##BO ##Y ' S LIFE WAS PH ##YS ##ICALLY ILL B ##AL ##ANCED LIKE AN O ##ARS ##MAN ' S IN THAT IT EX ##ER ##CI ##SE ##D ONLY CERTAIN MUS ##CL ##ES OF THE BODY

WE HAD EVERY SORT OF PEOPLE WITH US OFF AND ON AND AS I WAS LOOK ##OUT AT A PO ##P ##ULAR G ##AME I SAW THEM ALL
AT THE SAME INST ##ANT I HEARD THE R ##IP OF STE ##EL THROUGH CLOTH AND FELT A SHAR ##P ST ##AB IN MY LEFT LEG
THEN I SC ##OUT ##ED TO SEE WHAT HAD CUT ME AND FOUND THAT THE FELLOW HAD LOST A HAND
IN PLACE OF IT HE WOR ##E A SHAR ##P STE ##EL HO ##OK
THERE WAS NO DOUBT OF HIS BEING AL ##IVE FOR HE WAS BREATH ##ING HARD LIKE A MAN DOES WHEN HE GET ##S H ##IT OVER THE HEAD IT DIDN ' T SOUND GOOD
WHEN A MAN BREATH ##ES THAT WAY HE ' S MOST ##LY ALL GONE
MEN GOT BAT ##TED OVER THE HEAD OFTEN ENOUGH IN THOSE DAYS
SOU ##R WIN ##E IS FINE TO PUT A WO ##UND IN SH ##APE TO HEA ##L BUT IT ' S NO SO ##OTH ##ING SY ##RU ##P
THEIR CO ##FF ##IN WAS THEIR SHIP AND THEIR GRA ##VE IT WAS THE SEA BL ##OW HIGH BL ##OW LOW WHAT CARE WE AND THE QUAR ##TER THAT WE GAVE THEM WAS TO S ##INK THEM IN THE SEA DOWN ON THE CO ##AST OF THE HIGH BAR ##B ##ARE ##E
IT FAIR MADE MY HAIR R ##ISE TO HEAR HIM WITH THE BIG STILL SOL ##EM ##N DES ##ERT OUT ##SIDE AND THE QUIET MOON ##L ##IGHT AND THE SHAD ##OWS AND HIM SITTING UP STRAIGHT AND G ##AU ##N ##T HIS EYES BLA ##Z ##ING EACH SIDE HIS BIG E ##AG ##LE NO ##SE AND HIS SN ##AK ##Y HAIR HA ##NG ##ING OVER THE RA ##W CUT ACROSS HIS HEAD
HOWEVER I MADE OUT TO GET HIM B ##AND ##AGED UP AND IN SH ##APE AND PRETTY SOON HE SORT OF WENT TO SLEEP
THEN AGAIN HE ' D SING THAT BAR ##B ##ARE ##E SON ##G UNTIL I ' D GO OUT AND LOOK AT THE OLD COL ##OR ##AD ##O FLO ##W ##ING BY JUST TO BE SURE I HAD ##N ' T DIED AND GONE BEL ##OW OR ELSE HE ' D JUST TALK
HE BEGAN WHEN HE WAS A K ##ID AND HE GAVE HIS SIDE OF CONVERS ##ATIONS PA ##US ##ING FOR REP ##L ##IES
I USED TO LIST ##EN BY THE HOUR BUT I NEVER MADE OUT ANYTHING REALLY IMPORT ##ANT AS TO WHO THE MAN WAS OR WHERE HE ' D COME FROM OR WHAT HE ' D DONE
I DIDN ' T PAY ANY ATTENTION TO HIM FOR HE WAS QUIET
US ##UALLY I DIDN ' T BOTH ##ER WITH HIS TALK FOR IT DIDN ' T MEAN ANYTHING BUT SOMETHING IN HIS VOICE MADE ME TURN
HE WAS L ##YING ON HIS SIDE THOSE BLACK EYES OF HIS BLA ##Z ##ING AT ME BUT NOW BOTH OF THEM SAW THE SAME DISTANCE
WHERE ARE MY CLOTH ##ES HE ASKED VERY INT ##ENSE
ONE LITTLE SQU ##EE ##Z ##E TALK ABOUT YOUR DEAD ##LY WE ##AP ##ONS
BUT HE ' D BEEN TOO S ##ICK AND TOO LONG AB ##ED
IN A MIN ##UTE OR SO HE CAME TO
NOW YOU ' RE A N ##ICE SWEET PROP ##OSITION SAID I AS SOON AS I WAS SURE HE COULD UNDERSTAND ME
THEY ' RE SA ##FE ENOUGH LET ME HAVE THEM HE BEG ##GED
NOW LOOK HERE SAID I YOU CAN ' T GET UP TO DAY YOU A ##IN ' T F ##IT
I KNOW HE PLE ##ADE ##D BUT LET ME SEE THEM
JUST TO SATISF ##Y HIM I PASSED OVER HIS OLD DU ##D ##S
I ' VE BEEN ROB ##BED HE CRIED
WHERE ' S MY CO ##AT HE ASKED
YOU HAD NO CO ##AT WHEN I P ##ICKED YOU UP I REPLIED
HE LOOKED AT ME MIGHT ##Y SUS ##P ##IC ##IOUS BUT DIDN ' T SAY ANYTHING MORE HE WOULD ##N ' T EVEN ANSWER WHEN I SPOKE TO HIM
AFTER HE ' D EAT ##EN A FAIR ME ##AL HE FELL AS ##LE ##EP
WHEN I CAME BACK THAT EVENING THE BU ##N ##K WAS EM ##PT ##Y AND HE WAS GONE
I DIDN ' T SEE HIM AGAIN FOR TWO DAYS
THEN I CAUGHT SIGHT OF HIM QUITE A WAY ##S OFF
GU ##ESS HE SUS ##P ##IC ##IONS I STO ##LE THAT OLD CO ##AT OF HIS THINK ##S I AND AFTER ##WARDS I FOUND THAT MY SUR ##M ##ISE HAD BEEN COR ##RE ##CT
HOWEVER HE DIDN ' T STAY LONG IN THAT FR ##AME OF MIND
I RAN UP PULL ##ING MY GU ##N
THE ME ##X WAS FL ##AT ON HIS FACE HIS ARMS STRE ##T ##CHED OUT
ON THE MID ##DLE OF HIS BACK KN ##EL ##T MY ONE ARM ##ED FRIEND
ANY ##WAY I THR ##UST THE MU ##Z ##Z ##LE OF MY COL ##T ' S INTO THE SA ##IL ##OR ' S FACE WHAT ' S THIS I ASKED
I WEE ##N HE ##EM AT MON ##TE OFF AN ##TON ##I ##O CUR ##VE ##Z SAID HE
THE GL ##E ##AM DIED FROM HIS EYE THE SN ##AR ##L LEFT HIS LIPS
IN ANY CASE HE FLE ##W PO ##CO PRO ##N ##TO LEA ##VING ME AND MY FRIEND TOGETHER
DURING THE NEXT TWO MONTH ##S HE WAS A GOOD DEAL ABOUT TOWN MOST ##LY DOING O ##D ##D JO ##BS I SAW HIM OFF AND ON
HOWEVER I DIDN ' T PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO THAT BEING AT THE TIME AL ##M ##IGHT ##Y BUS ##Y HOLD ##ING DOWN MY CAR ##D G ##AMES
THAT ' S ALL RIGHT SAID I BUT YOU BETTER STAY RIGHT THERE
I WANT TO MAKE UP TO YOU FOR YOUR TROUBLE SAID HE
WHAT KIND OF A GOOD THING I ASKED TRE ##AS ##URE SAID HE
HE LOOKED ALL RIGHT ENOUGH NEITHER DR ##UN ##K NOR LO ##CO
SIT DOWN SAID I OVER THERE THE OTHER SIDE THE TABLE
HE DID SO NOW FIRE AWAY SAID I
AND IT ' S A BIG THING SAID HAND ##Y SOL ##OM ##ON TO ME FOR THEY ' S NOT ONLY GOLD BUT AL ##T ##AR JE ##W ##ELS AND D ##IAM ##OND ##S
IT WILL MAKE US RICH AND A DO ##Z ##EN LIKE US AND YOU CAN K ##ISS THE BOOK ON THAT
THAT MAY ALL BE TRUE SAID I BUT WHY DO YOU TELL ME
WHY DON ' T YOU GET YOUR TRE ##AS ##URE WITHOUT THE NEED OF DIV ##ID ##ING IT
WHY MAT ##E HE ANSWERED IT ' S JUST PLAIN GRA ##T ##ITUDE
DIDN ' T YOU SAVE MY LIFE AND N ##USS ME AND TAKE CARE OF ME WHEN I WAS N ##IGH K ##ILLED
LOOK HERE AND ##ERS ##ON OR HAND ##Y SOL ##OM ##ON OR WHATEVER YOU PLEASE TO CALL YOURSELF I RE ##J ##O ##INED TO THIS IF YOU ' RE GOING TO DO BUSINESS WITH ME AND I DO NOT UNDERSTAND YET JUST WHAT IT IS YOU WANT OF ME YOU ' LL HAVE TO TALK STRAIGHT
IT ' S ALL VERY WELL TO SAY GRA ##T ##ITUDE BUT THAT DON ' T GO WITH ME
THE DEV ##IL ' S A PRE ##ACH ##ER IF YOU A ##IN ' T LOST YOUR P ##IN ##FE ##ATHER ##S SAID HE
WELL IT ' S THIS THEN I GOT TO HAVE A BOAT TO GET THERE AND SHE MUST BE STO ##CK ##ED
AND I GOT TO HAVE HELP WITH THE TRE ##AS ##URE IF IT ' S LIKE THIS FELLOW SAID IT WAS
IT ' S MONEY I GOT TO HAVE AND IT ' S MONEY I HAVE ##N ' T GOT AND CAN ' T GET UN ##LESS I LET SOME ##BODY IN AS PAR ##D ##NER
WHY ME I ASKED WHY NOT HE RET ##ORT ##ED
WE TALK ##ED THE MATTER OVER AT LENGTH
I STOOD OUT FOR A LARGE ##R PARTY
HE STRONG ##LY OPP ##OSED THIS AS DEP ##RE ##CI ##ATING THE SHAR ##ES BUT I HAD NO INT ##ENTION OF GOING ALONE INTO WHAT WAS THEN CONSIDER ##ED A WILD AND DANGER ##OUS COUNTRY FIN ##ALLY WE COMP ##RO ##M ##ISED
A THIRD OF THE TRE ##AS ##URE WAS TO GO TO HIM A THIRD TO ME AND THE REST WAS TO BE DIV ##IDED AMONG THE MEN WHOM I SHOULD SE ##LE ##CT THIS SCH ##EM ##E DID NOT APP ##E ##AL TO HIM
J ##UN ##IOR AV ##ON ##LE ##A FOUND IT HARD TO SET ##TLE DOWN TO HUM ##D ##RU ##M EXIST ##ENCE AGAIN
PERHAPS AFTER A WHILE I ' LL GET USED TO IT BUT I ' M AFRAID CONCER ##TS SP ##O ##IL PEOPLE FOR EVERY ##DAY LIFE
I SUPPOSE THAT IS WHY MAR ##ILL ##A DISAPP ##RO ##VES OF THEM
I FEEL JUST NOW THAT I MAY GR ##OW UP TO BE SENS ##IBLE YET
I JUST LAY AW ##AKE AND IMAG ##INED THE CONCER ##T OVER AND OVER AGAIN
EVEN ##T ##UALLY HOWEVER AV ##ON ##LE ##A SCHOOL SL ##IP ##PE ##D BACK INTO ITS OLD GR ##OO ##VE AND TOOK UP ITS OLD INTEREST ##S
NONE OF THE SL ##O ##ANE ##S WOULD HAVE ANY DEAL ##INGS WITH THE BELL ##S BECAUSE THE BELL ##S HAD DECL ##ARED THAT THE SL ##O ##ANE ##S HAD TOO MUCH TO DO IN THE PRO ##GR ##AM AND THE SL ##O ##ANE ##S HAD RET ##ORT ##ED THAT THE BELL ##S WERE NOT CAP ##ABLE OF DOING THE LITTLE THEY HAD TO DO PROPER ##LY

I CAN SCARCE ##LY REAL ##IZE THAT I ' M IN MY TE ##ENS
IT ' S A GREAT COMFORT TO THINK THAT I ' LL BE ABLE TO USE BIG WORDS THEN WITHOUT BEING LAUGH ##ED AT

IF I HAD AL ##ICE BELL ' S CR ##OOK ##ED NO ##SE SAID ANN ##E DEC ##IDED ##LY I WOULD ##N ' T BUT THERE
I ' M AFRAID I THINK TOO MUCH ABOUT MY NO ##SE EVER SINCE I HEARD THAT COMP ##L ##IMENT ABOUT IT LONG AGO
OH D ##IAN ##A LOOK THERE ' S A RA ##B ##BIT
THEY ' RE SO WHITE AND STILL AS IF THEY WERE AS ##LE ##EP AND DREAM ##ING PRETTY DREAM ##S
I WR ##OTE IT LAST MON ##DAY EVENING
IT ' S CALLED THE JE ##AL ##OUS R ##IV ##AL OR IN DEATH NOT DIV ##IDED
I READ IT TO MAR ##ILL ##A AND SHE SAID IT WAS ST ##UFF AND NO ##N ##SE ##N ##SE
IT ' S A SAD SWEET STORY
COR ##DE ##L ##IA WAS A REG ##AL BR ##UNE ##T ##TE WITH A COR ##ONE ##T OF MID ##N ##IGHT HAIR AND DU ##S ##K ##LY FL ##ASH ##ING EYES
YOU KNOW SO MUCH MORE THAN YOU DID WHEN YOU WERE ONLY TW ##ELVE
THEY GREW IN BEAUTY SIDE BY SIDE UNTIL THEY WERE SIX ##TEEN
I ASKED RU ##BY GI ##LL ##IS IF SHE KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT HOW MEN PROP ##OSED BECAUSE I THOUGHT SHE ' D LIKE ##LY BE AN AUTHOR ##ITY ON THE SUBJECT HAVING SO MANY SISTER ##S MAR ##RIED
BUT SHE PRET ##END ##ED TO BE GE ##RA ##LD ##INE ' S FRIEND THE SAME AS EVER
LET YOU AND ME HAVE A STORY CL ##UB ALL OUR OWN AND WR ##ITE STO ##RIE ##S FOR PRACT ##ICE
YOU OUGHT TO C ##ULT ##IV ##ATE YOUR IMAG ##INATION YOU KNOW MISS ST ##AC ##Y SAYS SO
ONLY WE MUST TAKE THE RIGHT WAY
THIS WAS HOW THE STORY CL ##UB CAME INTO EXIST ##ENCE
NO BOYS WERE ALL ##OWED IN IT ALTHOUGH RU ##BY GI ##LL ##IS OPIN ##ED THAT THEIR ADM ##ISS ##ION WOULD MAKE IT MORE EXC ##ITING AND EACH MEM ##BER HAD TO PRODU ##CE ONE STORY A WEE ##K
EACH GIRL HAS TO READ HER STORY OUT LO ##UD AND THEN WE TALK IT OVER
MINE IS RO ##S ##AM ##OND MON ##T ##M ##ORE ##N ##CY ALL THE GIRLS DO PRETTY WELL
I ' M SURE THAT MUST HAVE A WHOLE ##SO ##ME EFFECT
THE MOR ##AL IS THE GREAT THING MISTER ALL ##AN SAYS SO
I READ ONE OF MY STO ##RIE ##S TO HIM AND MISSUS ALL ##AN AND THEY BOTH AG ##REE ##D THAT THE MOR ##AL WAS EXC ##ELL ##ENT
J ##ANE AND RU ##BY ALMOST ALWAYS CRY WHEN I COME TO THE PAT ##H ##ET ##IC PART ##S
MISS JO ##SE ##PH ##INE BAR ##RY WR ##OTE BACK THAT SHE HAD NEVER READ ANYTHING SO AM ##US ##ING IN HER LIFE
I ' M SURE MISSUS ALL ##AN WAS NEVER SUCH A SIL ##LY FORG ##ET ##FUL LITTLE GIRL AS YOU ARE
I FELT SO ENC ##OURA ##GED WHEN I HEARD THAT
MISSUS L ##Y ##ND ##E SAYS SHE ALWAYS FEEL ##S SHO ##CK ##ED WHEN SHE HEAR ##S OF ANY ##ONE EVER HAVING BEEN N ##AUGHT ##Y NO MATTER HOW SMALL THEY WERE
NOW I WOULD ##N ' T HAVE FELT THAT WAY
VAN ##ITY AND VE ##X ##ATION OF SPIRIT
THE SPR ##ING WAS AB ##RO ##AD IN THE LAND AND MAR ##ILL ##A ' S SO ##BER MID ##DLE AGE ##D STEP WAS LIGHT ##ER AND SW ##IFT ##ER BECAUSE OF ITS DEEP PR ##IM ##AL GLAD ##NESS
I MUST SAY WITH ALL HER FA ##ULT ##S I NEVER FOUND HER DIS ##O ##BED ##IENT OR UNT ##RU ##ST ##W ##ORT ##H ##Y BEFORE AND I ' M REAL SO ##R ##RY TO FIND HER SO NOW
PERHAPS YOU ' RE JUD ##GING HER TOO HAST ##Y MAR ##ILL ##A
OF COURSE I KNEW YOU ' D TAKE HER PART MAT ##TH ##EW BUT I ' M BRING ##ING HER UP NOT YOU
DEM ##AND ##ED MAR ##ILL ##A ANX ##IOUSLY GOING OVER TO THE BED
ANN ##E CO ##W ##ERED DEEP ##ER INTO HER P ##ILL ##OWS AS IF DES ##IR ##OUS OF H ##ID ##ING HERSELF FORE ##VER FROM MOR ##T ##AL EYES NO
GET RIGHT UP THIS MIN ##UTE AND TELL ME
THIS MIN ##UTE I SAY THERE NOW WHAT IS IT
ANN ##E HAD SL ##ID TO THE FLOOR IN DESP ##AIR ##ING OB ##ED ##IENCE
YES IT ' S GREEN MO ##ANE ##D ANN ##E
I THOUGHT NOTHING COULD BE AS BAD AS RED HAIR
YOU HAVE ##N ' T GOT INTO ANY SC ##RA ##PE FOR OVER TWO MONTH ##S AND I WAS SURE ANOTHER ONE WAS DU ##E
NOW THEN WHAT DID YOU DO TO YOUR HAIR
ANN ##E SH ##IRL ##EY DIDN ' T YOU KNOW IT WAS A W ##ICKED THING TO DO
YES I KNEW IT WAS A LITTLE W ##ICKED ADM ##ITTED ANN ##E
I KNOW WHAT IT FEEL ##S LIKE TO HAVE YOUR WORD DOUBT ##ED
AND MISSUS ALL ##AN SAYS WE SHOULD NEVER SUS ##PECT ANY ##ONE OF NOT TELL ##ING US THE TRUTH UN ##LESS WE HAVE PRO ##O ##F THAT THEY ' RE NOT
BUT I HAD ##N ' T THEN AND I BELIEVE ##D EVERY WORD HE SAID IMP ##LIC ##IT ##LY
WHO SAID WHO ARE YOU TALK ##ING ABOUT
OH I DIDN ' T LET HIM IN THE HOUSE
IN A TRI ##CE I SAW MYSELF WITH BEAUTIFUL RA ##VEN BLACK HAIR AND THE TEM ##PT ##ATION WAS IR ##RES ##IST ##IBLE
OH MAR ##ILL ##A WHAT A T ##ANG ##LED WE ##B WE WE ##AVE WHEN FIRST WE PRACT ##ICE TO DEC ##E ##IVE
YOUR HAIR MUST BE CUT OFF THERE IS NO OTHER WAY YOU CAN ' T GO OUT WITH IT LOOKING LIKE THAT
WITH A DIS ##MA ##L S ##IGH SHE WENT FOR THE SC ##ISS ##ORS
BUT THERE IS NOTHING COMFORT ##ING IN HAVING YOUR HAIR CUT OFF BECAUSE YOU ' VE D ##Y ##ED IT A DR ##EAD ##FUL COL ##OR IS THERE
I ' M GOING TO WEE ##P ALL THE TIME YOU ' RE CUT ##TING IT OFF IF IT WON ' T INTER ##FE ##RE
IT SEEMS SUCH A TRA ##G ##IC THING
ANN ##E WE ##PT THEN BUT LATER ON WHEN SHE WENT UP ##ST ##AIRS AND LOOKED IN THE GLASS SHE WAS CAL ##M WITH DESP ##AIR
YES I WILL TOO
I NEVER THOUGHT I WAS V ##AIN ABOUT MY HAIR OF ALL THINGS BUT NOW I KNOW I WAS IN SP ##ITE OF ITS BEING RED BECAUSE IT WAS SO LONG AND THICK AND CUR ##LY
I EXPECT SOMETHING WILL HAPP ##EN TO MY NO ##SE NEXT
ANN ##E ' S CL ##IP ##PE ##D HEAD MADE A SENS ##ATION IN SCHOOL ON THE FOLLOW ##ING MON ##DAY BUT TO HER REL ##IEF NO ##BODY GU ##ESSED THE REAL REASON FOR IT NOT EVEN JO ##S ##IE P ##Y ##E WHO HOWEVER DID NOT FA ##IL TO INFORM ANN ##E THAT SHE LOOKED LIKE A PERFECT SCAR ##E ##C ##RO ##W
IT ' S HARD TO BE TOLD YOU LOOK LIKE A SCAR ##E ##C ##RO ##W AND I WANTED TO SAY SOMETHING BACK BUT I DIDN ' T
IT MAKES YOU FEEL VERY VI ##R ##T ##U ##OUS WHEN YOU FORG ##IVE PEOPLE DOES ##N ' T IT
I MEAN TO DEV ##OTE ALL MY EN ##ER ##G ##IES TO BEING GOOD AFTER THIS AND I SHALL NEVER TRY TO BE BEAUTIFUL AGAIN
OF COURSE IT ' S BETTER TO BE GOOD
I DO REALLY WANT TO BE GOOD MAR ##ILL ##A LIKE YOU AND MISSUS ALL ##AN AND MISS ST ##AC ##Y AND GR ##OW UP TO BE A CRE ##D ##IT TO YOU
D ##IAN ##A SAYS WHEN MY HAIR BEGIN ##S TO GR ##OW TO T ##IE A BLACK VE ##L ##VE ##T R ##IB ##BO ##N AROUND MY HEAD WITH A BO ##W AT ONE SIDE
I WILL CALL IT A SN ##OOD THAT SOUND ##S SO ROM ##ANT ##IC
MY HEAD IS BETTER NOW
IT WAS TERRI ##BLE BAD THIS AFTER ##N ##OON THOUGH
OF COURSE YOU MUST BE EL ##AIN ##E ANN ##E SAID D ##IAN ##A
OF COURSE IT WOULD BE ROM ##ANT ##IC CON ##CED ##ED J ##ANE AND ##REW ##S BUT I KNOW I COULD ##N ' T KEEP STILL
BUT IT ' S SO RID ##IC ##UL ##OUS TO HAVE A RED ##H ##EAD ##ED EL ##AIN ##E MO ##URN ##ED ANN ##E
AND EL ##AIN ##E WAS THE LI ##LY MAID
YOUR COMPLE ##X ##ION IS JUST AS FAIR AS RU ##BY ' S SAID D ##IAN ##A EAR ##NE ##ST ##LY AND YOUR HAIR IS EVER SO MUCH DARK ##ER THAN IT USED TO BE BEFORE YOU CUT IT
IT WAS SP ##LE ##ND ##ID TO FISH FOR TR ##OUT OVER THE BR ##ID ##GE AND THE TWO GIRLS LEAR ##NED TO RO ##W THEMSELVES ABOUT IN THE LITTLE FL ##AT BO ##T ##TO ##MED DO ##RY MISTER BAR ##RY KEPT FOR DU ##CK SHO ##OT ##ING
IT WAS ANN ##E ' S IDEA THAT THEY DRA ##MA ##T ##IZE EL ##AIN ##E
THOSE DAYS SHE SAID WERE SO MUCH MORE ROM ##ANT ##IC THAN THE PRESENT
THEY HAD OFTEN GONE DOWN LIKE THIS AND NOTHING COULD BE MORE CONV ##EN ##IENT FOR PLAY ##ING EL ##AIN ##E
THE BLACK SH ##AW ##L HAVING BEEN PRO ##C ##URED ANN ##E SPR ##EAD IT OVER THE FL ##AT AND THEN LAY DOWN ON THE BO ##T ##TO ##M WITH CLOSE ##D EYES AND HANDS FO ##LD ##ED OVER HER BRE ##AST
IT SP ##O ##ILS THE EFFECT BECAUSE THIS IS HUNDRED ##S OF YEARS BEFORE MISSUS L ##Y ##ND ##E WAS BORN
J ##ANE YOU ARR ##ANGE THIS
IT ' S SIL ##LY FOR EL ##AIN ##E TO BE TALK ##ING WHEN SHE ' S DEAD
J ##ANE ROSE TO THE OCCASION
LEFT BEHIND AT THE LAND ##ING
ANN ##E GAVE ONE G ##ASP ##ING LITTLE SC ##REAM WHICH NO ##BODY EVER HEARD SHE WAS WHITE TO THE LIPS BUT SHE DID NOT LO ##SE HER SELF POSS ##ESSION
THERE WAS ONE CHANCE JUST ONE
UNDER SUCH CIRCUMST ##ANCES YOU DON ' T THINK MUCH ABOUT MAKING A FLO ##W ##ERY PRAY ##ER
THE FL ##AT DRI ##FT ##ED UNDER THE BR ##ID ##GE AND THEN PROM ##PT ##LY SA ##N ##K IN MID ##ST ##REAM
RU ##BY J ##ANE AND D ##IAN ##A ALREADY AW ##A ##ITING IT ON THE LOW ##ER HEAD ##LAND SAW IT DISAPP ##EAR BEFORE THEIR VERY EYES AND HAD NOT A DOUBT BUT THAT ANN ##E HAD GONE DOWN WITH IT
THE MINUTES PASSED BY EACH SEEM ##ING AN HOUR TO THE UN ##FORT ##UN ##ATE LI ##LY MAID
WHY DIDN ' T SOME ##BODY COME WHERE HAD THE GIRLS GONE
HER IMAG ##INATION BEGAN TO SUGG ##EST ALL MANNER OF GR ##UES ##OME POSS ##IB ##IL ##ITIES TO HER

THEY WERE IN THE LAND THIS PEOPLE SAID BEFORE THE MOON HAD COME INTO THE SK ##Y
AND MANY OF THE MAG ##IC ##IANS OF E ##GY ##PT WHO HAD COME WITH KING SE ##SO ##ST ##RI ##S STAY ##ED IN THAT CITY OF A ##E ##A AND THEY T ##AUGHT PEOPLE SPE ##LL ##S THAT COULD STAY THE MOON IN HER GOING AND COMING IN HER R ##ISING AND SET ##TING
MED ##E ##A TOO HIS W ##ISE DAUGHTER KNEW THE SECRET ##S T ##AUGHT BY THOSE WHO COULD SW ##AY THE MOON
FOR J ##ASON WAS THE GRAND ##SON OF CRE ##TH ##E ##US AND CRE ##TH ##E ##US WAS THE BROTHER OF AT ##H ##AM ##AS THEIR GRAND ##F ##ATHER
J ##ASON TOOK PE ##LE ##US AND TE ##LA ##M ##ON WITH HIM
AS THEY CAME TO THE CITY A MIST FELL AND J ##ASON AND HIS COM ##RA ##DE ##S WITH THE SON ##S OF PH ##RI ##X ##US WENT THROUGH THE CITY WITHOUT BEING SEEN
THE MIST LI ##FT ##ED AND BEFORE THE HER ##O ##ES WAS THE WONDER OF THE PAL ##ACE IN THE BRIGHT LIGHT OF THE MORNING
ON EACH SIDE OF THE COURT ##Y ##ARD WERE THE PAL ##ACE BUILD ##INGS IN ONE KING A E ##ET ##ES LIVED WITH AP ##S ##Y ##R ##T ##US HIS SON AND IN THE OTHER CH ##AL ##CI ##OP ##E AND MED ##E ##A LIVED WITH THEIR HAND ##MA ##IDE ##N ##S
AND THEN A DO ##VE FLE ##W TOWARD HER IT WAS BEING CH ##ASED BY A HA ##W ##K AND MED ##E ##A SAW THE HA ##W ##K ' S EYES AND BE ##AK
WE PULL ##ED AWAY FROM THAT PLACE AND THERE ##A ##FT ##ER WE WERE DRI ##VEN BY THE WIND ##S BACK TO THE MOUTH OF THE PH ##AS ##IS
WITH HIM THERE CAME THE MIGHT ##IEST OF THE HER ##O ##ES OF GRE ##E ##CE
ALREADY HE HAS HEARD OF YOUR BIT ##TER FO ##ES THE SA ##UR ##OM ##AT ##A ##E
HE WITH HIS COM ##RA ##DE ##S WOULD SUB ##DU ##E THEM FOR YOU
A E ##ET ##ES ' S HEART WAS FILLED WITH WR ##ATH AS HE LOOKED UPON THEM AND HIS EYES SHO ##NE AS A LE ##OP ##ARD ' S EYES
AND THEN SPEAK ##ING TO THE KING IN A QUIET VOICE J ##ASON SAID
HIS HEART WAS DIV ##IDED AS TO WHETHER HE SHOULD SUM ##M ##ON HIS ARM ##ED MEN AND HAVE THEM SLA ##IN UPON THE SP ##OT OR WHETHER HE SHOULD PUT THEM INTO DANGER BY THE TRI ##AL HE WOULD MAKE OF THEM
IT MAY BE THAT YE ARE TR ##UL ##Y OF THE SEE ##D OF THE IM ##M ##ORT ##ALS
AND IT MAY BE THAT I SHALL GIVE YOU THE GOLD ##EN FLE ##E ##CE TO BEAR AWAY AFTER I HAVE MADE TRI ##AL OF YOU
SHE ENTERED SOFT ##LY AND SHE STOOD AWAY FROM HER FATHER AND THE FOUR WHO WERE SPEAK ##ING WITH HIM
SHE HAD A DARK FACE THAT WAS MADE VERY STRANGE BY HER CROW ##N OF GOLD ##EN HAIR
KNOW THAT ON THE PLAIN OF ARE ##S Y ##OND ##ER I HAVE TWO FIRE BREATH ##ING BU ##LL ##S WITH FEET OF BRA ##S ##S
THEN I SO ##W ##ED THE FUR ##RO ##W ##S NOT WITH THE SEE ##D THAT DEM ##ETER GIVE ##S BUT WITH TE ##ETH OF A DRA ##G ##ON
IF YOU CAN ACCOM ##PL ##ISH THIS THAT I ACCOM ##PL ##ISHED IN DAYS GONE BY I SHALL SUB ##M ##IT TO YOU AND GIVE YOU THE GOLD ##EN FLE ##E ##CE
BUT IF YOU CANNOT ACCOM ##PL ##ISH WHAT I ONCE ACCOM ##PL ##ISHED YOU SHALL GO FROM MY CITY EM ##PT ##Y HAND ##ED FOR IT IS NOT RIGHT THAT A BRA ##VE MAN SHOULD Y ##IELD A ##UGHT TO ONE WHO CANNOT SHOW HIMSELF AS BRA ##VE
THEN J ##ASON UT ##TER ##LY CONF ##OUNDED CAST HIS EYES UPON THE GROUND
I WILL DA ##RE THIS CONT ##EST MON ##ST ##RO ##US AS IT IS
AS HE SAID THIS HE SAW THE EYES OF MED ##E ##A GR ##OW W ##IDE AS WITH FEAR
PH ##RO ##N ##T ##IS AND ME ##LA ##S WENT TO WHERE THEIR MOTHER WAS
AND AS A MOR ##T ##AL AP ##OL ##L ##O SOU ##GHT TO EAR ##N HIS BRE ##AD AMONG ##ST MEN
AFTER ##WARD PEOPLE WONDER ##ED AT ADM ##ET ##US ' S EVER SM ##ILING FACE AND EVER RA ##D ##IAN ##T BEING
THAT WAS BEFORE ADM ##ET ##US SA ##ILED ON THE AR ##G ##O WITH J ##ASON AND THE COMPAN ##IONS OF THE QUEST
THERE ##A ##FT ##ER ADM ##ET ##US HAVING THE LOVE OF AL ##CES ##T ##IS WAS EVEN MORE HAPPY THAN HE HAD BEEN BEFORE
A RA ##D ##IAN ##T FIG ##URE IT WAS AND ADM ##ET ##US KNEW THAT THIS WAS AP ##OL ##L ##O COME TO HIM AGAIN
BUT AP ##OL ##L ##O TURNED TO ADM ##ET ##US A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY
WHAT YEARS OF HAPP ##INESS HAVE BEEN MINE O AP ##OL ##L ##O THROUGH YOUR FRIENDS ##H ##IP FOR ME SAID ADM ##ET ##US
BUT STILL AP ##OL ##L ##O STOOD BEFORE HIM WITH A FACE THAT WAS WITHOUT JOY
HE SPOKE AND HIS VOICE WAS NOT THAT CLEAR AND VI ##BR ##ANT VOICE THAT HE HAD ONCE IN SPEAK ##ING TO ADM ##ET ##US
ADM ##ET ##US ADM ##ET ##US HE SAID IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT YOU MAY NO MORE LOOK ON THE BLUE SK ##Y NOR WALK UPON THE GREEN EARTH
IT IS FOR ME TO TELL YOU THAT THE GOD OF THE UNDER ##W ##OR ##LD WILL HAVE YOU COME TO HIM ADM ##ET ##US ADM ##ET ##US KNOW THAT EVEN NOW THE GOD OF THE UNDER ##W ##OR ##LD IS SEND ##ING DEATH FOR YOU
IF ONE WILL GO WILL ##INGLY IN THY PLACE WITH DEATH THOU CAN ##ST STILL LIVE ON GO ADM ##ET ##US
AND THEN HE CAME UPON AN AN ##CIENT WOMAN WHO SAT UPON STONE ##S IN THE COURT ##Y ##ARD GR ##IND ##ING CORN BETWEEN TWO STONE ##S
THERE SHE WAS SITTING AS HE HAD FIRST KNOWN HER WITH HER EYES BL ##EAR ##ED AND HER KN ##EE ##S SH ##AKING AND WITH THE DU ##ST OF THE COURT ##Y ##ARD AND THE HUS ##KS OF THE CORN IN HER MAT ##TED HAIR
HE WENT TO HER AND SPOKE TO HER AND HE ASKED HER TO TAKE THE PLACE OF THE KING AND GO WITH DEATH
BUT WHEN SHE HEARD THE NAME OF DEATH HOR ##RO ##R CAME INTO THE FACE OF THE AN ##CIENT WOMAN AND SHE CRIED OUT THAT SHE WOULD NOT LET DEATH COME NEAR HER
ADM ##ET ##US TOOK THE MAN ' S SH ##RI ##VEL ##ED HAND AND HE ASKED HIM IF HE WOULD NOT TAKE THE KING ' S PLACE AND GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM
THEN ADM ##ET ##US WENT INTO THE PAL ##ACE AND INTO THE CH ##AM ##BER WHERE HIS BED WAS AND HE LAY DOWN UPON THE BED AND HE LA ##MENT ##ED THAT HE WOULD HAVE TO GO WITH DEATH THAT WAS COMING FOR HIM FROM THE GOD OF THE UNDER ##W ##OR ##LD AND HE LA ##MENT ##ED THAT NONE OF THE WR ##ET ##CHED ONE ##S AROUND THE PAL ##ACE WOULD TAKE HIS PLACE
ONE SHOULD GO IN YOUR PLACE FOR YOU ARE THE KING AND HAVE MANY GREAT AFF ##AIRS TO ATT ##END TO
NOW THE FOOT ##ST ##EP ##S SEEMED TO STO ##P
IT WAS NOT SO TERRI ##BLE FOR HIM AS BEFORE
AND THE WORDS HE HAD SPOKE ##N HE WOULD HAVE TAKEN BACK THE WORDS THAT HAD BROUGHT HER CONSE ##N ##T TO GO WITH DEATH IN HIS PLACE
DEATH WOULD SOON BE HERE FOR HER
NO NOT HERE FOR HE WOULD NOT HAVE DEATH COME INTO THE PAL ##ACE
HE LI ##FT ##ED AL ##CES ##T ##IS FROM THE BED AND HE CARRIED HER FROM THE PAL ##ACE
NO MORE SPE ##E ##CH CAME FROM HER
AND AS FOR ADM ##ET ##US HE WENT WITHIN THE CH ##AM ##BER AND KN ##EL ##T BESIDE THE BED ON WHICH AL ##CES ##T ##IS HAD LA ##IN AND THOUGHT OF HIS TERRI ##BLE LO ##S ##S
TO WHAT GOD IS THAT SA ##CRI ##F ##ICE DU ##E
AND THEN HER ##AC ##LES FELT THAT ANOTHER LAB ##OR WAS BEFORE HIM
I HAVE DRA ##GG ##ED UP FROM THE UNDER ##W ##OR ##LD HE THOUGHT THE HO ##UND THAT GU ##ARDS THOSE WHOM DEATH BRING ##S DOWN INTO THE REAL ##M OF THE GOD OF THE UNDER ##W ##OR ##LD
WHY SHOULD I NOT STRI ##VE WITH DEATH
AND WHAT A NO ##BLE THING IT WOULD BE TO BRING BACK THIS FAITH ##FUL WOMAN TO HER HOUSE AND TO HER HUSBAND
HE LEFT THE PAL ##ACE OF ADM ##ET ##US AND HE WENT TO THE TEM ##PLE OF THE GOD ##S
YOU ARE HELD BY ME DEATH AND YOU WILL NOT BE LET GO UN ##LESS YOU PROM ##ISE TO GO FORTH FROM THIS TEM ##PLE WITHOUT BRING ##ING ONE WITH YOU
AND DEATH KNOW ##ING THAT HER ##AC ##LES COULD HOLD HIM THERE AND THAT THE BUSINESS OF THE GOD OF THE UNDER ##W ##OR ##LD WOULD BE LEFT UN ##D ##ONE IF HE WERE HELD PROM ##ISED THAT HE WOULD LEAVE THE TEM ##PLE WITHOUT BRING ##ING ONE WITH HIM
SHE WAS VE ##ILED AND ADM ##ET ##US COULD NOT SEE HER FE ##AT ##URES
HERE IS A WOMAN WHOM I AM BRING ##ING BACK TO HER HUSBAND I WON HER FROM AN ENEM ##Y
THIS I CANNOT DO SAID ADM ##ET ##US I HAVE HAD PA ##NG ##S ENOUGH
THEN ADM ##ET ##US RA ##ISED THE VE ##IL OF THE WOMAN HE HAD TAKEN ACROSS THE THR ##ESH ##OLD OF HIS HOUSE
HE NOW WENT ON TILL HE CAME TO THE HOUSE AT THE DOOR OF WHICH HE WAS TO KN ##OCK THIS HE DID TWO OR THREE TIMES
CHRIST ##IAN I HAVE COME TO SEE THE GOOD MAN OF THE HOUSE
CHRIST ##IAN SIR I AM COME FROM THE CITY OF DEST ##RU ##CTION AND AM ON MY WAY TO MO ##UNT Z ##ION
I WAS TOLD BY THE MAN THAT STAND ##S AT THE G ##ATE THAT IF I CAME HERE YOU WOULD SHOW ME GOOD THINGS THAT WOULD HELP ME
HE STOOD AS IF HE WOULD PLE ##AD FOR MEN AND A CROW ##N OF GOLD HUNG NEAR HIS HEAD
CHRIST ##IAN WHAT DOES THIS MEAN
THEN HE TOOK HIM TO A LARGE ROOM THAT WAS FULL OF DU ##ST FOR IT HAD NOT BEEN SWE ##PT AND INTER ##PR ##ETER TOLD HIS MAN TO SWE ##EP IT
CHRIST ##IAN WHAT MEANS THIS
THEN YOU NEXT SAW THE MAID COME IN TO LAY THE DU ##ST SO IS S ##IN MADE CLE ##AN AND LAID LOW BY FAITH IN THE BOOK
JUST AS CHRIST ##IAN CAME UP TO THE CROSS HIS LO ##AD SL ##ID FROM HIS BACK CLOSE TO THE MOUTH OF THE TOM ##B WHERE IT FELL IN AND I SAW IT NO MORE
AS HE STOOD THUS AND WE ##PT LO THREE BRIGHT ONE ##S CAME TO HIM AND ONE OF THEM SAID PEACE BE TO THEE THOU HAST GRACE FROM THY S ##INS
CHRIST ##IAN GAVE THREE LEA ##PS FOR JOY AND SA ##NG AS HE WENT AH WHAT A PLACE IS THIS BL ##EST CROSS BL ##EST TOM ##B
HE WENT ON THUS TILL HE CAME TO A VAL ##E WHERE HE SAW THREE MEN WHO WERE IN A SOUND SLEEP WITH CH ##AINS ON THEIR FEET
CHRIST ##IAN SIR ##S WHEN ##CE COME YOU AND WHERE DO YOU GO
FORM ##AL ##IST AND H ##Y ##P ##OC ##RI ##S ##Y WE WERE BORN IN THE LAND OF V ##AIN GL ##ORY AND ARE ON OUR WAY TO MO ##UNT Z ##ION FOR PR ##A ##ISE
KNOW YOU NOT THAT HE THAT COMES NOT IN AT THE DOOR BUT CL ##IM ##BS UP TO GET IN THE SAME IS A TH ##IEF
THEY TOLD CHRIST ##IAN THAT HE HAD NO NEED FOR CARE ON THAT SC ##ORE FOR LONG USE HAD MADE IT LAW AND THEY COULD PROV ##E THAT IT HAD BEEN SO FOR YEARS
YES SAID THEY NO DOUBT OF IT
AND IF WE GET IN THE ROAD AT ALL PRAY WHAT ARE THE O ##D ##D ##S
IS NOT OUR CASE AS GOOD AS YOUR ##S
I SAW THEN THAT THEY ALL WENT ON TILL THEY CAME TO THE FOOT OF THE HILL OF DIFFIC ##ULT ##Y WHERE THERE WAS A SPR ##ING
NOW WHEN CHRIST ##IAN GOT AS FAR AS THE SPR ##ING OF LIFE HE DRA ##N ##K OF IT AND THEN WENT UP THE HILL
NOW HALF WAY UP WAS A CA ##VE MADE BY THE LORD OF THAT HILL THAT THOSE WHO CAME BY MIGHT REST THERE
TIM ##OR ##OUS SAID THAT Z ##ION WAS THE HILL THEY MEANT TO CL ##IM ##B BUT THAT WHEN THEY HAD GOT HALF WAY THEY FOUND THAT THEY MET WITH MORE AND MORE R ##IS ##K SO THAT GREAT FEAR CAME ON THEM AND ALL THEY COULD DO WAS TO TURN BACK
YES SAID MIST ##RU ##ST FOR JUST IN FRONT OF US THERE LAY TWO BE ##AST ##S OF PRE ##Y IN OUR PAT ##H WE KNEW NOT IF THEY SLE ##PT OR NOT BUT WE THOUGHT THAT THEY WOULD FALL ON US AND TEAR OUR LIM ##BS
YET HE THOUGHT ONCE MORE OF WHAT HE HAD HEARD FROM THE MEN AND THEN HE FELT IN HIS CL ##O ##AK FOR HIS SC ##RO ##LL THAT HE MIGHT READ IT AND FIND SOME PEACE
HE FELT FOR IT BUT FOUND IT NOT
SO HE FELL DOWN ON HIS KN ##EE ##S TO PRAY THAT GOD WOULD GIVE HIM GRACE FOR THIS ACT AND THEN WENT BACK TO LOOK FOR HIS SC ##RO ##LL
OH FOOL THAT I AM SAID HE TO SLEEP IN THE DAY TIME SO TO GIVE WAY TO THE FLE ##SH AS TO USE FOR EAS ##E THAT REST WHICH THE LORD OF THE HILL HAD MADE BUT FOR THE HELP OF THE SOUL
SUCH WAS THE LO ##T OF THE JE ##W ##S FOR THEIR S ##IN THEY WERE SENT BACK BY THE WAY OF THE RED SEA AND I AM MADE TO TRE ##AD THOSE STEP ##S WITH GR ##IEF WHICH I MIGHT HAVE TR ##OD WITH JOY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THIS SLEEP
HOW FAR MIGHT I HAVE BEEN ON MY WAY BY THIS TIME
NOW BY THIS TIME HE HAD COME TO THE VAL ##E ONCE MORE WHERE FOR A SPE ##LL HE SAT DOWN AND WE ##PT BUT AT LAST AS HE CAST A SAD GL ##ANCE AT THE FOOT OF THE BE ##N ##CH HE SAW HIS SC ##RO ##LL WHICH HE CAUGHT UP WITH HAST ##E AND PUT IN HIS CL ##O ##AK
WORDS ARE TOO WE ##AK TO TELL THE JOY OF CHRIST ##IAN WHEN HE HAD GOT BACK HIS SC ##RO ##LL
HE LAID IT UP IN THE BRE ##AST OF HIS CO ##AT AND GAVE THAN ##KS TO GOD
WITH WHAT A LIGHT STEP DID HE NOW CL ##IM ##B THE HILL
AH THOUGHT HE THESE BE ##AST ##S RAN ##GE IN THE NIGHT FOR THEIR PRE ##Y AND IF THEY SHOULD MEET WITH ME IN THE DARK HOW SHOULD I FL ##Y FROM THEM
THE NAME OF THE MAN WHO KEPT THE LO ##D ##GE OF THAT HOUSE WAS WATCH ##FUL AND WHEN HE SAW THAT CHRIST ##IAN MADE A HA ##LT AS IF HE WOULD GO BACK HE CAME OUT TO HIM AND SAID IS THY STRENGTH SO SMALL
FEAR NOT THE TWO WILD BE ##AST ##S FOR THEY ARE BOUND BY CH ##AINS AND ARE PUT HERE TO TRY THE FAITH OF THOSE THAT HAVE IT AND TO FIND OUT THOSE THAT HAVE NONE
KEEP IN THE MID ##ST OF THE PAT ##H AND NO HAR ##M SHALL COME TO THEE
THEN I SAW IN MY DREAM THAT STILL HE WENT ON IN GREAT DR ##EAD OF THE WILD BE ##AST ##S HE HEARD THEM RO ##AR YET THEY DID HIM NO HAR ##M BUT WHEN HE HAD GONE BY THEM HE WENT ON WITH JOY TILL HE CAME AND STOOD IN FRONT OF THE LO ##D ##GE WHERE WATCH ##FUL D ##W ##EL ##T
CHRIST ##IAN SIR WHAT HOUSE IS THIS MAY I REST HERE TO NIGHT
WHEN WATCH ##FUL TOLD HER WHY CHRIST ##IAN HAD COME THERE SHE SAID WHAT IS YOUR NAME
THEN CHRIST ##IAN BE ##N ##T DOWN HIS HEAD AND WENT WITH THEM TO THE HOUSE
PIE ##TY COME GOOD CHRIST ##IAN SINCE OUR LOVE PROM ##PT ##S US TO TAKE YOU IN TO REST LET US TALK WITH YOU OF ALL THAT YOU HAVE SEEN ON YOUR WAY
CHRIST ##IAN WITH A RIGHT GOOD WILL AND I AM GLAD THAT YOU SHOULD ASK IT OF ME
PR ##UDE ##N ##CE AND FIRST SAY WHAT IS IT THAT MAKES YOU WISH SO MUCH TO GO TO MO ##UNT Z ##ION
THERE THEY SAY IS NO DEATH AND THERE I SHALL D ##W ##ELL WITH SUCH AS LOVE THE LORD
CHAR ##ITY HAVE YOU A WIFE AND BAB ##ES CHRIST ##IAN YES I HAVE
CHAR ##ITY AND WHY DID YOU NOT BRING THEM WITH YOU
BUT THEY WOULD NOT COME WITH ME NOR HAVE ME LEAVE THEM
THUS DID CHRIST ##IAN TALK WITH THESE FRIENDS TILL IT GREW DARK AND THEN HE TOOK HIS REST IN A LARGE ROOM THE NAME OF WHICH WAS PEACE THERE HE SLE ##PT TILL BREAK OF DAY AND THEN HE SA ##NG A H ##Y ##M ##N
AND THEY BROUGHT OUT THE J ##AW BO ##NE OF AN ASS WITH WHICH SA ##MS ##ON DID SUCH GREAT FE ##ATS AND THE SL ##ING AND STONE WITH WHICH DA ##V ##ID SLE ##W GO ##L ##IA ##TH OF G ##ATH
WHAT IS THE NAME OF THIS LAND SAID CHRIST ##IAN
THEN THEY TOLD HIM IT WAS IM ##MAN ##UE ##L ' S LAND
MORE THAN THIS HE HAT ##H BEEN HEARD TO RA ##IL ON YOU MY LORD WHO ARE NOW HIS JUD ##GE
JUD ##GE THY JUST DO ##OM WOULD BE TO DIE ON THE SP ##OT STILL LET US HEAR WHAT THOU HAST TO SAY
THEN THE JUD ##GE TO SUM UP THE CASE SPOKE THUS YOU SEE THIS MAN WHO HAS MADE SUCH A ST ##IR IN OUR TOWN
THUS WHILE ONE LOST HIS LIFE FOR THE TRUTH A NEW MAN ROSE FROM HIS DEATH TO TRE ##AD THE SAME WAY WITH CHRIST ##IAN
COME GOOD HOPE ##FUL SAID CHRIST ##IAN LET US WALK ON THE GRA ##S ##S
SO THEY SET OFF THROUGH THE FIELD
HOPE ##FUL I HAD MY FEAR ##S FROM THE FIRST AND SO GAVE YOU A H ##INT CHRIST ##IAN GOOD FRIEND I GR ##IE ##VE THAT I HAVE BROUGHT YOU OUT OF THE RIGHT PAT ##H
HOPE ##FUL SAY NO MORE NO DOUBT IT IS FOR OUR GOOD
CHRIST ##IAN WE MUST NOT STAND THUS LET US TRY TO GO BACK
THEN SAID GI ##ANT DESP ##AIR YOU HAVE NO RIGHT TO FORCE YOUR WAY IN HERE THE GROUND ON WHICH YOU LIE IS MINE
THEY HAD NOT MUCH TO SAY AS THEY KNEW THAT THEY WERE IN FA ##ULT
AND BY THIS ACT WE K ##ILL OUR SOUL ##S AS WELL
FOUR WHETHER IN THAT STATE MAN WOULD HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MEN
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INN ##OC ##ENCE MAN HAD NO MASTER ##SHIP OF THE ANIM ##ALS
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INN ##OC ##ENCE BEFORE MAN HAD DIS ##O ##BE ##Y ##ED NOTHING DIS ##O ##BE ##Y ##ED HIM THAT WAS NATURAL ##LY SUBJECT TO HIM
SECOND ##LY THIS IS PROV ##ED BY THE ORDER OF DIV ##INE PROV ##IDENCE WHICH ALWAYS GOVERN ##S INF ##ER ##IOR THINGS BY THE SUPER ##IOR
THIRD ##LY THIS IS PROV ##ED FROM A PROPER ##TY OF MAN AND OF OTHER ANIM ##ALS
NOW WHATEVER IS PARTIC ##IP ##ATED IS SUBJECT TO WHAT IS ES ##SE ##N ##T ##IAL AND UN ##IVER ##S ##AL
THEREFORE THE SUBJECT ##ION OF OTHER ANIM ##ALS TO MAN IS PROV ##ED TO BE NATURAL
THEY WOULD NOT HOWEVER ON THIS ACCOUNT HAVE BEEN EXCEPT ##ED FROM THE MASTER ##SHIP OF MAN AS NEITHER AT PRESENT ARE THEY FOR THAT REASON EXCEPT ##ED FROM THE MASTER ##SHIP OF GOD WHOSE PROV ##IDENCE HAS ORD ##AINED ALL THIS
THIS IS SIGN ##IFIED BY THE FACT THAT GOD LED THE ANIM ##ALS TO MAN THAT HE MIGHT GIVE THEM NAME ##S EXPRESS ##IVE OF THEIR RESPECT ##IVE NATURE ##S
SO ALL ANIM ##ALS WOULD HAVE OB ##EY ##ED MAN OF THEIR OWN ACCORD AS IN THE PRESENT STATE SOME DO ##ME ##ST ##IC ANIM ##ALS OB ##EY HIM
OBJECT ##ION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE STATE OF INN ##OC ##ENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE HAD MASTER ##SHIP OVER ALL OTHER CREAT ##URES
MUCH LESS THEREFORE WOULD IT HAVE OB ##EY ##ED MAN IN THE STATE OF INN ##OC ##ENCE
THEREFORE SINCE IT IS BY HIS REASON THAT MAN IS COMP ##ET ##ENT TO HAVE MASTER ##SHIP IT SEEMS THAT IN THE STATE OF INN ##OC ##ENCE MAN HAD NO DO ##M ##IN ##ION OVER PLAN ##TS
NOW IN MAN REASON HAS THE POSITION OF A MASTER AND NOT OF A SUBJECT
I ANSWER THAT WE MUST NEED ##S ADM ##IT THAT IN THE PR ##IM ##IT ##IVE STATE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN SOME IN ##E ##QU ##ALITY AT LEAST AS REGARD ##S SE ##X BECAUSE GENER ##ATION DEP ##END ##S UPON DIV ##ERS ##ITY OF SE ##X AND LIKE ##W ##ISE AS REGARD ##S AGE FOR SOME WOULD HAVE BEEN BORN OF OTHERS NOR WOULD SE ##X ##UAL UN ##ION HAVE BEEN STE ##RI ##LE
THERE MIGHT ALSO HAVE BEEN BO ##D ##ILY DISP ##AR ##ITY
IN ##E ##QU ##ALITY MIGHT ALSO AR ##ISE ON THE PART OF NATURE AS ABOVE DES ##CRIB ##ED WITHOUT ANY DEF ##ECT OF NATURE
OBJECT ##ION ONE IT WOULD SEEM THAT IN THE STATE OF INN ##OC ##ENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN MASTER OVER MAN
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INN ##OC ##ENCE MAN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN SUBJECT TO MAN
IN ANOTHER SENSE MASTER ##SHIP IS REF ##ER ##RED IN A GENERAL SENSE TO ANY KIND OF SUBJECT AND IN THIS SENSE EVEN HE WHO HAS THE OFFIC ##E OF GOVERN ##ING AND DIRECT ##ING FREE MEN CAN BE CALLED A MASTER
SUCH A KIND OF MASTER ##SHIP WOULD HAVE EXIST ##ED IN THE STATE OF INN ##OC ##ENCE BETWEEN MAN AND MAN FOR TWO REASON ##S
BUT IN THE STATE OF INN ##OC ##ENCE THERE WOULD HAVE BEEN NO WE ##AK ##NESS OF OLD AGE
ON THE CONTR ##ARY EVERYTHING GENER ##ATED IS FIRST IMP ##ER ##FECT BUT IN THE STATE OF INN ##OC ##ENCE CHILDREN WOULD HAVE BEEN BEG ##OTT ##EN BY GENER ##ATION
THEREFORE FROM THE FIRST THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN IMP ##ER ##FECT IN BO ##D ##ILY S ##IZE AND POWER
THEREFORE IN THE STATE OF INN ##OC ##ENCE THERE WAS NO NEED FOR WOMEN TO BE BORN ON THE CONTR ##ARY NATURE ' S PRO ##CESS IN GENER ##ATION WOULD HAVE BEEN IN HAR ##M ##ONY WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH IT WAS EST ##AB ##LISH ##ED BY GOD
I HAVE BEEN TOLD THAT MISTER VAN BRA ##ND ##T IS IN PRISON FOR DE ##B ##T I SAID
AND I SAW FOR MYSELF LAST NIGHT THAT HE HAD LEFT YOU HELP ##LESS
HE LEFT ME THE LITTLE MONEY HE HAD WITH HIM WHEN HE WAS ARR ##ESTED SHE RE ##J ##O ##INED SAD ##LY
HIS CR ##UE ##L CRE ##D ##IT ##ORS ARE MORE TO BLA ##ME THAN HE IS FOR THE PO ##VER ##TY THAT HAS FALL ##EN ON US
EVEN THIS NE ##G ##ATIVE DEF ##ENSE OF VAN BRA ##ND ##T ST ##UNG ME TO THE QUICK I OUGHT TO HAVE SPOKE ##N MORE GU ##ARD ##ED ##LY OF HIM I SAID BIT ##TER ##LY
I OUGHT TO HAVE REMEMBER ##ED THAT A WOMAN CAN FORG ##IVE ALMOST ANY WRONG THAT A MAN CAN INFL ##ICT ON HER WHEN HE IS THE MAN WHOM SHE LOVE ##S
SHE PUT HER HAND ON MY MOUTH AND STOPPED ME BEFORE I COULD SAY ANY MORE
HOW CAN YOU SPEAK SO CR ##UE ##LLY TO ME SHE ASKED
YOU KNOW TO MY SH ##AME I CONF ##ESSED IT TO YOU THE LAST TIME WE MET YOU KNOW THAT MY HEART IN SECRET IS ALL YOUR ##S
WHAT WRONG ARE YOU TALK ##ING OF
IS IT THE WRONG I SUFF ##ERED WHEN VAN BRA ##ND ##T MAR ##RIED ME WITH A WIFE LIVING AT THE TIME AND LIVING STILL
DO YOU THINK I CAN EVER FORG ##ET THE GREAT MIS ##FORT ##UNE OF MY LIFE THE MIS ##FORT ##UNE THAT HAS MADE ME UN ##W ##ORT ##H ##Y OF YOU
IT IS NO FA ##ULT OF MINE GOD KNOW ##S BUT IT IS NOT THE LESS TRUE THAT I AM NOT MAR ##RIED AND THAT THE LITTLE DA ##R ##LING WHO IS PLAY ##ING OUT THERE WITH HER DO ##LL IS MY CHILD
AND YOU TALK OF MY BEING YOUR WIFE KNOW ##ING THAT THE CHILD ACCEPT ##S ME AS HER SECOND FATHER I SAID
IT WOULD BE BETTER AND HAPP ##IER FOR US BOTH IF YOU HAD AS LITTLE PR ##IDE AS THE CHILD PR ##IDE SHE REPE ##ATED
IN SUCH A POSITION AS MINE
A HELP ##LESS WOMAN WITH A MO ##CK HUSBAND IN PRISON FOR DE ##B ##T
AM I TO MAR ##RY YOU FOR MY FOOD AND SHE ##LT ##ER
AM I TO MAR ##RY YOU BECAUSE THERE IS NO LAW ##FUL T ##IE THAT B ##IND ##S ME TO THE FATHER OF MY CHILD
BAD AS HE IS HE HAS NOT FOR ##S ##AKEN ME HE HAS BEEN FORCE ##D AWAY
MY ONLY FRIEND IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU THINK ME UN ##GR ##ATE ##FUL ENOUGH TO CONSE ##N ##T TO BE YOUR WIFE
THE WOMAN IN MY SIT ##U ##ATION MUST BE HEART ##LESS INDEED WHO COULD DEST ##RO ##Y YOUR PLACE IN THE EST ##IM ##ATION OF THE WORLD AND THE REGARD OF YOUR FRIENDS
THE WR ##ET ##CHED ##EST CREAT ##URE THAT WALK ##S THE STREET ##S WOULD SH ##RI ##N ##K FROM TREAT ##ING YOU IN THAT WAY
OH WHAT ARE MEN MADE OF
HOW CAN YOU HOW CAN YOU SPEAK OF IT
I Y ##IELD ##ED AND SPOKE OF IT NO MORE
EVERY WORD SHE UT ##TERED ONLY INC ##RE ##ASED MY ADM ##IR ##ATION OF THE NO ##BLE CREAT ##URE WHOM I HAD LOVED AND LOST
BIT ##TER ##LY AS I HAT ##ED THE MAN WHO HAD PART ##ED US I LOVED HER DEAR ##LY ENOUGH TO BE EVEN CAP ##ABLE OF HELP ##ING HIM FOR HER SA ##KE HOPE ##LESS INF ##AT ##U ##ATION
I DON ' T DEN ##Y IT I DON ' T EXC ##USE IT HOPE ##LESS INF ##AT ##U ##ATION YOU HAVE FORG ##IVE ##N ME I SAID
LET ME DES ##ER ##VE TO BE FORG ##IVE ##N
IT IS SOMETHING TO BE YOUR ONLY FRIEND
YOU MUST HAVE PLAN ##S FOR THE F ##UT ##URE TELL ME UN ##RES ##ER ##VED ##LY HOW I CAN HELP YOU
COMPLE ##TE THE GOOD WORK THAT YOU HAVE BEG ##UN SHE ANSWERED GRA ##TE ##FULLY HELP ME BACK TO HEA ##LT ##H
MAKE ME STRONG ENOUGH TO SUB ##M ##IT TO A DOCTOR ' S EST ##IM ##ATE OF MY CHANCE ##S OF LIVING FOR SOME YEARS YET
A DOCTOR ' S EST ##IM ##ATE OF YOUR CHANCE ##S OF LIVING I REPE ##ATED WHAT DO YOU MEAN
I HARDLY KNOW HOW TO TELL YOU SHE SAID WITHOUT SPEAK ##ING AGAIN OF MISTER VAN BRA ##ND ##T
DOES SPEAK ##ING OF HIM AGAIN MEAN SPEAK ##ING OF HIS DE ##B ##TS I ASKED
WHY NEED YOU HE ##S ##IT ##ATE
YOU KNOW THAT THERE IS NOTHING I WILL NOT DO TO REL ##IE ##VE YOUR ANX ##IET ##IES
NEVER LET ME TELL YOU THE PLAIN TRUTH
THERE IS A SER ##IOUS NECESS ##ITY FOR HIS GETTING OUT OF PRISON
YES THIS IS HIS POSITION IN TWO WORDS A LITTLE WHILE SINCE HE OB ##TAINED AN EXC ##ELL ##ENT OFF ##ER OF EM ##PL ##OY ##MENT AB ##RO ##AD FROM A RICH REL ##ATIVE OF HIS AND HE HAD MADE ALL HIS ARR ##ANGE ##MENTS TO ACCEPT IT
UN ##H ##APP ##ILY HE RETURNED TO TELL ME OF HIS GOOD FORT ##UNE AND THE SAME DAY HE WAS ARR ##ESTED FOR DE ##B ##T
THE SN ##ARE THAT HAD BEEN SET FOR HER WAS PLAIN ##LY REV ##E ##ALE ##D IN THOSE FOUR WORDS
IN THE EYE OF THE LAW SHE WAS OF COURSE A SING ##LE WOMAN SHE WAS OF AGE SHE WAS TO ALL INT ##ENTS AND PURPOSE ##S HER OWN MIST ##RESS
WHAT WAS THERE TO PRE ##VENT HER FROM INS ##URING HER LIFE IF SHE PLEASE ##D AND FROM SO DISP ##OS ##ING OF THE INS ##UR ##ANCE AS TO GIVE VAN BRA ##ND ##T A DIRECT INTEREST IN HER DEATH
THAN ##KS TO THE HAPPY ACC ##IDENT OF MY POSITION THE ONE CERTAIN WAY OF PROT ##ECT ##ING HER LAY EAS ##ILY WITHIN MY REACH
I COULD OFF ##ER TO LE ##ND THE SC ##OUND ##RE ##L THE MONEY THAT HE WANTED AT AN HOUR ' S NOT ##ICE AND HE WAS THE MAN TO ACCEPT MY PROP ##OS ##AL QUITE AS EAS ##ILY AS I COULD MAKE IT
YOU ARE QUITE MIST ##AKEN I REPLIED
I AM ONLY DOUBT ##ING WHETHER YOUR PLAN FOR REL ##IE ##VING MISTER VAN BRA ##ND ##T OF HIS EMB ##ARR ##ASS ##MENTS IS QUITE SO SIM ##PLE AS YOU SUPPOSE
ARE YOU AW ##ARE OF THE DEL ##AY ##S THAT ARE LIKE ##LY TO TAKE PLACE BEFORE IT WILL BE POSSIBLE TO BO ##R ##RO ##W MONEY ON YOUR POL ##IC ##Y OF INS ##UR ##ANCE
I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT IT SHE SAID SAD ##LY
WILL YOU LET ME ASK THE ADV ##ICE OF MY LAW ##Y ##ERS
THEY ARE TR ##UST ##W ##ORT ##H ##Y AND EXPER ##IENCE ##D MEN AND I AM SURE THEY CAN BE OF USE TO YOU
CA ##UT ##IOUSLY AS I HAD EXPRESS ##ED MYSELF HER DEL ##IC ##AC ##Y TOOK THE AL ##AR ##M
PROM ##ISE THAT YOU WON ' T ASK ME TO BO ##R ##RO ##W MONEY OF YOU FOR MISTER VAN BRA ##ND ##T SHE RE ##J ##O ##INED AND I WILL ACCEPT YOUR HELP GRA ##TE ##FULLY
I COULD HON ##EST ##LY PROM ##ISE THAT
MY ONE CHANCE OF SA ##VING HER LAY IN KEEP ##ING FROM HER KNOWLEDGE THE COURSE THAT I HAD NOW DETERM ##INED TO PUR ##S ##UE
I ROSE TO GO WHILE MY RESOL ##UTION STILL SUS ##TAINED ME
K ##ISS ME SHE WHIS ##PER ##ED BEFORE YOU GO
IT IS ONLY YOUR GOOD ##NESS THAT OVER ##P ##OWERS ME
THE NEXT DAY EVERY ##BODY IN THE HOUSE BEGAN TO MAKE PREP ##AR ##ATIONS FOR THE JOUR ##NEY
EVERYTHING WAS DONE VERY LE ##IS ##URE ##LY THOUGH THERE WAS A LO ##T OF TALK ##ING AND DISP ##UT ##ING AND THE GI ##VING OF CONTR ##ARY ORDER ##S
THE OLD PORT ##ER WAS THERE DIRECT ##ING AND SC ##OLD ##ING THE SERV ##ANTS AS THEY P ##ILED THE RU ##GS AND BLA ##N ##KE ##TS AND B ##AG ##S OF FOOD AND PO ##TS AND PA ##N ##S AND DIS ##H ##ES INTO THE WA ##G ##ON
THERE WAS QUITE A PRO ##CESS ##ION WHEN AT LAST THE BIG WA ##G ##ON RU ##MB ##LED OUT THROUGH THE G ##ATE ##WAY
BEHIND IT CAME THE GRAND ##M ##OTHER IN HER D ##H ##OOL ##IE DA ##K A SORT OF A LI ##T ##TER OR EAS ##Y CHAIR SW ##UNG BETWEEN TWO LONG POL ##ES
BESIDES THE FAMILY THERE WERE MANY SERV ##ANTS AND SEVERAL OTHERS WALKED BESIDE THE SLOW MO ##VING WA ##G ##ON
THE CO ##OK TOO WENT WITH THEM
GOOD BY ##E SHO ##UTE ##D LITTLE N ##A ##O FROM HIS GARDEN WALL AS THEY WENT BY GOOD BY ##E
THEY SHO ##UTE ##D GRE ##ET ##INGS TO THEIR FRIEND THE PO ##T ##TER AS THEY PASSED HIM AND ALSO TO THE OLD FA ##K ##IR SM ##EAR ##ED ALL OVER WITH AS ##H ##ES WHO SAT IN A LITTLE BR ##ICK H ##UT BY THE BR ##ID ##GE AND PRET ##END ##ED TO MAKE WONDER ##FUL CUR ##ES
THIS IS MORE F ##UN THAN GOING TO SCHOOL SAID CH ##OL ##A AS THE O ##X ##EN PL ##OD ##DE ##D ALONG THROUGH CL ##OUD ##S OF DU ##ST
THESE LOVE ##LY BIRD ##S ARE FOUND NEARLY EVERY ##WHERE IN IND ##IA AND IN SOME PART ##S RUN QUITE WILD
HIS LONG MAT ##TED HAIR HUNG ON HIS SHOULD ##ERS AND HE WAS SAYING HIS PRAY ##ERS WITH THE HELP OF A RO ##S ##ARY OF BE ##AD ##S WHICH HE CONTIN ##UALLY PASSED THROUGH HIS HANDS
AS THE WA ##G ##ON CAME UP A YOUNG MAN WHO ACCOM ##P ##AN ##IED THE HO ##LY MAN RAN UP AND HELD OUT A BEG ##GING BO ##W ##L SAYING GIVE OH CHAR ##IT ##ABLE PEOPLE TO THIS HO ##LY ONE
NO COUNTRY IN THE WORLD HAS SO MANY BEG ##GAR ##S AS IND ##IA

WHEN THEY HAD EAT ##EN THEIR LU ##N ##CH THE YOUNG PEOPLE WENT TO EXPL ##ORE THE GARDEN NEAR THEM
PERHAPS THERE ARE DOG ##S SAID MA ##H ##AL ##A A LITTLE FEAR ##FULLY BUT THEY FORGOT ABOUT DOG ##S WHEN THEY SAW A THICK ##ET OF SU ##GAR CAN ##E DOWN BY A STRE ##AM
PERHAPS WE CAN BU ##Y SOME FROM THE MAN THERE HE IS NOW PL ##OUGH ##ING BY THE STRE ##AM SAID CH ##OL ##A
IT IS LOOKING FOR WATER SAID THE FAR ##MER AS HE TOOK A LONG ST ##ALK OF CAN ##E AND GENT ##LY GU ##IDED IT DOWN TO THE STRE ##AM
THE SN ##AKE IS ANOTHER SA ##C ##RED ANIM ##AL OF THE H ##IND ##US AND THEY WOULD NOT K ##ILL OR IN ##J ##URE ONE FOR ANYTHING
AS THEY WERE ABOUT TO MOVE ON AGAIN THEY SAW A GREAT CL ##OUD OF DU ##ST DOWN THE ROAD
IT TURNED OUT THAT IT WAS A GREAT AND POWER ##FUL RA ##J ##AH GOING IN STATE ON A JOUR ##NEY TO VISIT ANOTHER RA ##J ##AH OR RU ##LER OF ONE OF THE SMALL KING ##D ##OM ##S OR STATE ##S OF WHICH MO ##DER ##N IND ##IA WAS FORM ##ER ##LY MADE UP
FIRST THERE CAME A BIG ELE ##PH ##ANT ALL DEC ##OR ##ATED WITH SIL ##K AND GOLD AND SIL ##VER
ON THE ELE ##PH ##ANT ' S BACK WAS A HOW ##D ##AH WHICH IS LIKE A BIG CHAIR WITH A CAN ##OP ##Y OVER IT AND IN THIS SITTING CROSS LEG ##GED WAS THE RA ##J ##AH A BIG FAT FELLOW DRESS ##ED IN COL ##OUR ##ED SIL ##KS AND JE ##W ##ELS WITH A GREAT D ##IAM ##OND SET PL ##UM ##E IN HIS T ##UR ##B ##AN
BEHIND THE HOW ##D ##AH STOOD A SERV ##ANT HOLD ##ING A BIG U ##MB ##RE ##LL ##A OF FINE FE ##ATHER ##S OVER THE RA ##J ##AH ' S HEAD
THE DRI ##VER SAT ON THE NE ##CK OF THE ELE ##PH ##ANT AND GU ##IDED THE BIG BE ##AST BY PRO ##D ##D ##ING HIM ON ONE SIDE OR THE OTHER WITH AN IR ##ON SHO ##D ST ##ICK OR GO ##AD
IS ##N ' T IT FINE TO RID ##E LIKE THAT ON A BIG ELE ##PH ##ANT
AND ALL THE REST OF THE DAY THE LITTLE FO ##L ##K TALK ##ED OF NOTHING BUT THE GREAT RA ##J ##AH AND HIS ESC ##ORT
OUR PARTY CAME TO A HA ##LT AMONG MANY OTHER BU ##LL ##OCK CAR ##TS THE OWN ##ERS OF WHICH WERE ALREADY SITTING AROUND ON THE GROUND CO ##OK ##ING THEIR SUPP ##ERS OR BAR ##G ##AIN ##ING FOR FOOD AT THE LITTLE BO ##OTH ##S
